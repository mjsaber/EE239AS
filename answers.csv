I learned a huge amount doing it and some of it may help you.The first thing is that the world looks a lot different when your head is only a few inches above the water. I was meant to be aiming for the houses on the right but I couldn't see them and so aimed for the nipple on the left.You have no idea how far things are and because there are no landmarks close to you there's no parallax to help you judge your movement. It can make you feel really trapped. For this patience is the best answer. You have to learn that perception of movement is a lot slower and as you accept that it becomes easier.Then there are the waves.This looks beautiful doesn't it? There are also loads of amazing tropical fish here as you swim out across the reef. Once you get into the channel though it gets choppy. You have to learn a new set of skills on managing waves. Your pool skills are great for water that doesn't move. But here it does and you have to adapt. Think of it more like the comparison between trail and track running. On an athletics track everything is perfect and you can focus on your form. Here you are using your form to cope with the unexpected and always changing water. Practice and familiarity are the best approaches to this. The currents are hard. Because I aimed wrong I was further south than I should have been and I got caught by the current. This is really terrifying. I gave up, lay on my back and cried for a few minutes. It was so hard. When it comes to currents you have to change your mind about where you are going or you just fight. fight. fight. fight. No let up. This is one of those places in life where you can't quit because if you do you are screwed. It's a really good lesson - but a really hard one. I hated learning it but I pushed through and eventually hit the shore. That is my face and nose rammed into the sand and I lay there I was so tired.And then there are the beasties.....There aren't really any sharks (actually there were here and they killed a lot of sailors after the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin... a few hundred km away). The beasties are all in your own mind. The ones that see your little white feet flipping away in the water and think "Yum. Time for a snack". Getting out and swimming really helps to dispel these. So some tips.Improve your swimming form - this makes it a lot easierGet stronger. Knowing that you can knock off lots of 1 and 2km sets in a session gives you confidence. You can use this to push back on your mindSwim with a buddy or group. Always. if they can do it you can too. The group psychology is often effective - and they are there to rescue you.Go out int the water and just relax. Let yourself float or sink. It's not a big deal - much the same as in the pool but easier.Go out with fins and a snorkelDo some scuba diving Above all just get out there and learn about your fears and discomforts and push them back little by little.In retrospect I probably pushed too hard but many of the fears I had now have gone.Welcome to Triathlon Malaysia Website}}}

I definitely sympathize with your sense of anxiety. After being accustomed to the confined and regulated environment of the swimming pool, swimming in the ocean was really overwhelming at first.My first suggestion is simply to do more swimming outside the pool. There is so much more going on in open water-- currents, temperature variations, visibility changes, plants, fish and other wildlife, waves, and so on-- that it helps simply to give yourself some time to become accustomed to it. Perhaps do some snorkeling. Swim out a little ways from the shore and just hang out for a bit. You can't get out whenever you feel like it, so practice treading water in place to get your bearings and regain energy.Practice identifying a target some distance away and swimming straight towards it. Get used to how your perspective changes when you are in the middle of the water with no "edge". Understand how to check your progress and adjust if necessary.Swim at different times of day so you understand how to adapt your form to different conditions.Swimming a given distance in the ocean is much harder than swimming the same distance in the pool. In retrospect, for my pool swimming while I was preparing for this event, I wish I had spent less time on straight distance and more time on strength and interval training to build physical capacity. Once I pushed past my sense of intimidation I really started to enjoy my time in the water-- so much so that the swimming pool seems pretty dull now by comparison. Good luck!}}}

(visibilty can be poor in the sea, and you tend to veer off to the side you breath), and relax.  It's quite a liberating feeling to swim in open water.}}}

Although I was born and raised 200 metres away from the sea I still feel terribly uncomfortable more than 50 metres from shore and get panic attacks when I touch a foreign body.For me the solution was to subscribe for a race. It motivated me to practice a lot - but it was still mostly in the swimming pool, I couldn't get myself to clock meaningful distances in open water. Then, on race day, with the adrenaline rush and the encouraging company of my fellow participants - all the open water-related anxiety was gone! It was a truly enjoyable experience when this discomfort was replaced by a feeling of freedom that only the open sea can bring.I can't say I've overcome my issues with open water and I still find it hard to go in the deep on non-race days but I'm already planning my second swim [*].To make things even more fun, I decided to make my first ever open water swim, in 14 C water, without a wet suit! Thus, my focus was mostly on combating the cold and the typical open water issues were pushed to the back.Don't let the sun fool you - it's December, outside temperature 10C, water 14C* I'm thinking about Varna-Galata Swimming Marathon - August, Varna, Bulgaria; clear, warm water, beautiful beaches and ridiculously cheap. The water is technically not saline but brackish and is very easy on the eyes - one can even swim without goggles. Not to be confused with the picture above, which is l'Estartit, Span.}}}

I've found three things to be helpful in feeling less anxious. #3 is the most helpful (I think). 1: Swim with a buddy that is great at swimming. Just knowing that someone else is out there is comforting. If you have a panic attack or something - they can be your 'rock'. 2: Try to swim where your feet can touch the ground. If your mind starts to get the best of you, you can just stop and stand. 3: Swim with a wetsuit on. Although I don't 'love' the fact that I live in SF and HAVE to wear a wetsuit to swim in the ocean, it is very comforting. It provides a lot of buoyancy and helps calm the nerves. Good luck! Hope it helps.}}}

If the latter, while having lots of other people in the water can make you feel more confident and can also result in lots of other stresses. You may find yourself dealing with both the anxiety of deep water and the pressures of swimming in a crowd. Ideally you want to get used to these two things separately.You already have plenty of good suggestions here but one thing I don't think anyone has mentioned is to swim with some kind of floatation device. You can get inflatable bags that you can tow behind you. Not only do they help other people spot you in the water you can also use them to grab hold of and rest should you need to. Another suggestion would be to swim with someone next to you in a kayak.If it's the crowds in mass participation swims that bother you swimming with a club might help. Some clubs organise open water pool sessions where they remove the lane ropes and give people the chance to practice swimming in groups.Swimming is a journey. You don't have to do everything at once. Take your time to explore and extend your limits, and make sure you enjoy what you do.}}}

My aim at this point in time is to swim 375m (that's metres, not miles!) from Shelly Beach to The Bower beach in Sydney. I've done it before, it's just that I tried to do it once in choppy seas, panicked, tried to get out by scrambling across rocks and ended up with stitches in my leg. Then a swimming teacher took me out in the same place beyond my comfort zone, I panicked, and swum as fast back to shore as I could. That was a few years ago and I've not tried it since. I've been working on my stroke, endurance and confidence by doing swim squads, but I still feel anxious when I even think about going back to do the Shelly-Bower swim. I tried to do it last weekend and couldn't go more than 30m from the beach.Thank you for your story and reply, it's inspiring.}}}

I couldn't breath. Tight chest. Wound up breast stroking and back stroking whole way. It is a normal mammalian response to cold particularly on the face. So- for what it's worth: I finally went out and started the next race with the slowest possible strokes - so slow I felt like I was cutting through butter. Breathed deeply and slowly.  Let the pack pass me. Within 3-4 minutes I got stable and went normal pace and have never looked back. It's all about getting your body in equilibrium.}}}

Any tips or advices how to get through college would be great }}},{{{Melissa provided such helpful tips for this answer so I don't have too much more to add, but here are some things that I did to help overcome some of my anxiety in college when trying to study:Don't cram: You may think that you're being productive by studying in the morning to late at night, but you're not actually retaining all of that information. It helps if you break up your study time so that it isn't such a marathon and you don't tire yourself out by the end of it.Take little breaks + Reward yourself: It's important to make sure you're studying or doing your work for hours of the time, but make sure to take some time for yourself too. I used to hate knowing that I'd be wasting my weekends away on just studying so I decided to break it up by studying in the morning until lunch and then running an errand or taking an afternoon nap. Then I would start up again and make plans to catch up with friends over dinner. It made me feel like I was accomplishing more with my day and having a healthy balance. Eat three meals: You may think you may not need to, but eating re-energizes you and will keep your mind and body refreshed and ready to take on the next task.Ask for help: I used to think that I was just bad at taking tests, but when I was in college, I was finding that it was even more difficult to keep my focus during exams. I became sensitive to sound and every time someone sighed heavily over a problem or tapped their pencil on the desk, I would become distracted. Whenever someone even finished a test and left the room, my eyes would immediately dart to the door and I would wonder why I wasn't close to finishing yet. When I realized this, I decided to reach out to my university's learning center where I discovered how test taking would bring on anxiety for me. From that point on, if I ever felt a little bit more nervous about an upcoming test, I was allowed to take my test outside of the classroom away from my peers in a room at the learning center completely by myself. It made a significant difference as I started to feel more at ease and received better marks.}}}

Any tips or advices how to get through college would be great }}},{{{Here are some of the tricks that have helped me in college:Study for exams ahead of time: There's nothing worse for your ADHD/anxiety than leaving studying until the night before the test and not being well prepared. Go to the library: It's hard to study in your dorm room or in noisy places because you'll be easily distracted. At the library everyone is quiet and studying and that will help you do the same.Take notes: This will help you pay attention during class and remember what the important points were later.SelfControl: When you're doing work on the computer, it's easy to get distracted by social networking sites. To help yourself avoid wasting time, use SelfControl to help you temporarily block websites like Facebook, Twitter, Quora, reddit, Pinterest and any other sites you might waste time on.Go to the gym: It will clear your mind, reduce your stress, and help you focus after the workout.Get enough sleep: Sleep deprivation will make it even more difficult to focus the next day.Eat well: A healthy breakfast will help you focus right away in the morning. Avoiding sugars will help you avoid energy crashes.Positive reassurance: Don't freak yourself out before every test. In the end, it's not that important. I can't seem to get this one right—no matter how much I've prepared, I always get super nervous before tests, even though I've never had one that actually went badly.Take your meds: This will help reduce the impact of the ADHD/anxiety during the day and helps level the playing field so you can do just as well on a test or in class as anyone else. If you're used to taking meds most days, then forgetting them will really be a problem and you'll notice the difference....Even on weekends: Even if I'm not doing work over the weekend, I still don't want to be spacy (from ADD) in social situations with my friends.Keep a tasks list: Sometimes I get stressed when I have a ton of little things to do and it's hard to keep up with all of them. Keep a list on your phone/paper/whatever to remind you of what you need to do, and check them off as you go. This will also motivate you to actually complete the tasks.Set small, incremental goals: Sometimes it's hard for me to focus on a large project that isn't due for a while. Set small goals for yourself to stay on track and keep yourself motivated....And larger motivating goals: Reminding myself of my larger dreams and goals, and picturing myself there, keeps me on track and motivated to work to get myself there.}}}

It doesn't discriminate.It's a mental illness. Just because it's not like more main-stream illnesses doesn't mean it should be treated differently. Just like other mental illnesses, it is highly stigmatized. I wish this wasn't the case because so many people deal with some form of anxiety on a daily basis. Being able to talk about it without being looked down upon would be a beautiful thing and I think more people would be inclined to seek help, talk to others, and share their stories.It's not a cop-out or an excuse; anxiety is a very real thing. Some seem to think it's something you can just get over and that you can just relax. It's not like that at all. Some people who have anxiety can barely leave their houses, others are totally fine with things like that. Not all anxiety is the same, and it shouldn't be treated that way. That said, sometimes the thought of leaving the house is absolutely terrifying.There are different kinds of anxiety disorders: Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, etc.Anxiety attacks and panic attacks are two different things. Anxiety attacks are usually caused by a specific stressor (like fear) and aren't as intense as panic attacks. Panic attacks can happen for no reason whatsoever and are totally unpredictable. The symptoms of panic attacks are a little more intense — think heart palpitations, lots of trembling and shaking, feeling like you can't get enough air, etc. Panic attacks are also scary as hell (see Chelsea Henry's answer to Panic Attacks: What are panic attacks like?)If you're someone who is around a person who suffers from any type of anxiety, telling them to "relax" or "calm down" does not help, it mostly just makes us feel really stupid. I promise if we could relax, we so would.Anxiety can make you really really sleepy. After the adrenaline dies down, sometimes all you want to do is sleep.While anxiety can be treated with medication, it doesn't always have to be. Breathing techniques and guided imagery are invaluable; you can bring yourself down from a 9 to a 5-6 if you do them correctly!Learning to look at anxiety as a part of you rather than something that is wrong with you will help you deal with it so much better. It's just like having asthsma or a food allergy. It's just a part of who you are.[1] http://www.adaa.org/about-adaa/p...}}}

Time to get personal.I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and I struggle with anxiety all the time. Even when I don't realize I'm anxious, I probably am. In fact, this question made me realize I'm anxious right now. My leg is constantly moving, I'm tapping my finger, spinning my phone around in my hand, messing with my hair, grabbing at my skin, and/or playing with my clothes. Sometimes it gets really bad, and I have anxiety attacks. I sometimes literally physically freak out and shake my body around crazily; I look like a kid throwing a temper-tantrum, and it is extremely embarrassing in public places. If I'm unable to do my anxiety-relieving things (the before-mentioned things I do like shaking my leg) I can physically feel the anxiety build up until I have an anxiety attack, and certain places/objects/people/smells/textures/tastes/sights/sounds can set them off sometimes with little to no warning.I was raised in a loving, caring family and have never been abused, so it isn't because of anything like that. It's my GAD that makes it happen, even when nothing going on around me should make me anxious at all.It may be worth noting that I am on medicine for my GAD (as well as my OCD and Depression) and that without that medicine it is a lot worse; I don't even know how bad anymore, since it has gotten a lot worse in the last few years even though I started my medicine years before that.It is also worth noting that there are many people out there with much worse anxiety than mine; anxiety is also experienced in many different ways for different people.The moral of the story: Don't throw the word anxious around like it is nothing, and don't make fun of people for their anxiety; it can be a much larger struggle than it seems.}}}

I never knew this for many years while I suffered with it every day.There are over 40 million people suffering with an anxiety disorder, whether it be social anxiety or generalized anxiety disorder. Many of these poor souls are taking (and addicted) to mind-numbing anti-anxiety drugs that really don't help the problem at all.In fact, the most popular anxiety medications such as Xanax or Valium are incredibly addicting and can cause a lot of severe health problems. What is sad to me is that nobody has to take these drugs.Anxiety is not the easiest thing to beat, but it is 100% possible to do so without prescriptions or drinking excess amounts of alcohol. Take it from me, when you self medicate like that (like I did) you only end up with more anxiety and more problems.Anxiety can be beaten! That is the #1 thing that I think if people knew about the disorder they would have a much easier time dealing with it.If you are, or are thinking about taking any prescription benzodiazepines for an anxiety disorder, I wrote a blog post that can give you some information that will be helpful.Most Common Medications For Anxiety - What is a Safe Medication for Anxiety?I suffered for years, and learned a lot about what anxiety is,...and more importantly, what anxiety is not!}}}

Some who have read other answers I've given on this topic may already know this. Sorry. I have dealt with diagnosed Severe Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder and various other fun neuroses for as long as I  can remember. I got this, it seems, from my mother.I know that she only ever lashed out at the family. Physical, emotional, and mental abuse were battle-testedweapons in her arsenal. I never saw her act out at anyone else. Not extended family nor the children she kept in the daycare she ran out of our house (she wasn't the best mother but she was/is a damn good caregiver. Odd, that.)I learned this behavior from the best. Don't misunderstand me, I'm not placing the fault of my mistakes at my mother's feet nor am I justifying my behavior or your wife's. It may be that she learned her habit of lashing out from someone else. Just try to understand that your wife is very ill. Depression is a horrible disease because, unlike so many other treatable diseases, there is no "happy face" to put on it. It's an ugly disease. And that ugliness eats you up inside.To directly address your question; the only reason a depressed person acts out/ lashes out at their loved ones is because it's so much easier to put the blame on someone outside of us and you present the best and closest target. Yes, she is ultimately responsible for her actions but her actions are the result of sickness. Would you blame someone with a stomach illness for vomiting on you? No. Same basic idea here. She is "vomiting" out all the poisons inside of her. Be there for her, love her, stay strong for her. Go to some of her appointments with her and speak honestly. The therapist will say it's a safe place and it is. I assure you, with the right help and possibly even medication she will be a much happier, healthier person. Once she starts improving, I suggest you seek couples' counseling so that you can repair the bridges she's damaged in her illness. If she's anything like most depressed individuals I know, she will want to.Good luck! Stay strong. I wish the best for you two!}}}

Something about your personality makes her feel both secure about your love for her or your connection to her and oblivious of the consequences of her behavior -- until, as you say -- recently. Much is missing from the question details so I'm going to just noodle around with my human satellite dish and broadcast a few ideas from which you can pick and choose whatever works for you. We don't know what the source of her anger is and whether there is something that you continue to do that enflames that source. You say she's getting treatment for her anger toward you. What did you do to elicit this anger? Is it justified? She may think so. She may also be too proud to let others see how dissatisfied she is with her husband. It will take time for her to process her anger and you just have to deal with it and try not to make it worse -- unless you've already really made up your mind to leave. If you are hedging your bets she may be picking up on that and that doesn't feel good at all. Right off the bat, I'm wondering why you have quote marks around the word anger where you refer to your wife's emotional difficulty in your question details. It seems as if there is something about her anger you are unwilling to accept. This in itself, if I were in her shoes, could be anger inducing. The first step in diffusing someone's anger is to acknowledge that it is there; maybe you are unable to do this and she doesn't realize that. You haven't told us how old you two are. She may be going through menopause or some other hormonal adjustment, like during childbirth and right afterward. Every woman experiences all of these periods differently. The changes to our bodies can make us feel truly crazy and misunderstood by the very people who should stand by us unquestioningly.}}}

She is projecting on you. That it is happening the way you have described, indicates there is a high likelihood someone who was supposed to love her, let her down. You are the stand in for that person. There is something you are doing or not doing that is triggering her. One of the more common ways couples try to fix this themselves is to never trigger it. The only problem with that is...it can't be done because the issue is contaminated with a ghost who can seep into anything, at any time and you typically won't see it coming. You can be sensitive to it but ultimately it is her problem. She has unfinished business from her past she is unable or unwilling to fix. Sometimes it is just what was modeled to them as the way to deal with conflicts with loved ones.That's also why her learning to control the energy won't really fix it. It may actually make it way worse for later. She needs a therapist skilled at healing that hole inside. Typically confronting the original caregiver results in a measly one percent fix ratio. Pretty sucky. There are methods to learn how to get that blessing healed and then you can have you wife back similar to the one you dated. Good luck.}}}

It may be that she only feels safe enough to display her true feelings with you.It seems from your description that she has an almost supernatural degree of self-control that enables her to continue to function "normally" in the real world. My sense is that that probably worsens her outbursts towards you.That said, therein, however, lies the problem. She may have some legitimate issues with you. She's depressed. That's bad, sad and horrible to watch.If your relationship is to last, it's not just about her "anger" towards you. I suspect that wasn't between quotation marks for nothing?It's also about her figuring out whether that anger is not a final defense mechanism (anger masking profound, existential sadness and/or grief) to not "fall apart" altogether. It's about you figuring out what your boundaries are. It's about helping her finding back her footing through individual therapy and perhaps, medication. It's about the two of you, hopefully together in counseling, figuring out what you are projecting onto each other. And lastly, hopefully, redefining your joint notion of a healthy relationship together. Or, if you do decide to part ways, to do the work necessary not to take the grief and hurt into a next relationship.I wish you kindness and wisdom towards yourselves and each other.}}}

I’m even having trouble writing down what I’m feeling, because that means trying to grasp my thoughts, which seems impossible. Right now it feels like everything that can go wrong, will. I woke up this morning convinced that I have done some serious damage to my brain chemistry, because I’ve been smoking a lot of hash for the past few months. Another worry that is passing through my brain is: “I’m not going to attain to anything, because I can’t and won’t make use of my degree…so the rest of my life I’m going to be miserable and pointless. ”  But the main thought that is troubling me right now is actually a revisited worry. It’s the fear that not only that I’m gay, but also that I have feelings for my best friend. This thought originated when I first got depersonalization when I was 16, and it returns every so often.  We hung out last night, and we smoked which was a horrible idea. The whole time I was examining how I was feeling, and then panicked as I realized I was actually thinking before talking, and thinking about how I could be perceived…when she’s normally the only person I care 0% what she thinks of me.

He’s been one of my best friends for the past 2 years, long story short: we’re both in love with each other. He’s normally always on my mind, and last week I cried all day when I realized it couldn’t work out, but now I hardly feel any feelings for him…which may just be my anxiety…but it’s still making me panic. “What if I never had feelings for him? What if I’m incapable of feeling anything for anyone?” “What if I can’t attain an emotional connection with men?”At the moment I know what is happening, but I can’t seem to get out of these panic thought loops. I think this is a result from smoking, having too much free time to worry and probably the emotional stress from my friend whom I have feelings for. I think I need to start seeing my psychologist again. }}},{{{Ok, as a person who has had panic attacks before, I can offer you my perspective. Everyone has anxious thoughts from time to time - what turns them into a panic attack is often the combination of mind-altering substances and a tendency to panic in the face of anxiety. Your feelings snowball and then you get out of control really quickly. Here is what I did to help myself:1. Stop taking any drugs which increase my likelihood to panic or obsess about things. I'm not anti-drugs by any means, but you need to know yourself. I stayed completely away from it for more than 5 years and it definitely helped. I made a promise to myself that I never wanted to feel that way again, which removed all temptation for me.2. This is the hardest part. You have to feel your fear and accept it. Experience it as a thought and not necessarily true or untrue. The specific content of the thoughts that are causing your anxiety aren't actually that important. My fears were about losing control and spiraling into mental illness. What's important is that you've given up control of your mind to them. Your thoughts have no power in and of themselves. Your thoughts can't hurt you. Being with your fear is a very difficult thought experiment and it took me months of trying to see any real improvement. A psychologist can help guide you in this, but don't wait until you see them to start. Trying to dull the thoughts with sex, substances or distractions won't help you develop a better strategy to dealing with them. Avoiding things that trigger the thoughts (being alone, being in a crowd etc.) will only reinforce in your mind that the thoughts are dangerous. You need to be really brave to turn and face the monsters in your mind. But once you do this, you will be free. 3. Be comforted by the fact that, while it feels like you're the only person in the world this is happening to, many people have experienced what you're experiencing. This isn't a permanent state, and how long it lasts is ultimately up to you. So be kind to yourself, and when you do recover, try to help someone else who is in your situation now.}}}

Again, a professional can help you ease into your troubles and better objectively identify your problems.I want you to try to see yourself as if you're in a movie, in third person.  Try to do this daily for fun. Imagine having an eye in the sky looking down at you and your actions.  Some people might find that when they're overwhelmed by emotion, a step back to look at oneself from the sky might help them see their surroundings.  A change in focus, it is a step back from being trapped in the head.For addictions to drugs, the user who wants to quit will usually have to remove them from his/her surroundings and anything that triggers the cycle to start. if they're constantly reminded of drugs, will-power alone will more then likely not be enough.  Self-depreciation, shame, any of the sort of bad emotions might cause the user to start to use drugs again as an excuse to relieve stress.  What helps is to belong to a supportive group of people who are committed to changing their lives.  Some people find their reason in religion, near-death experiences, or even just the desire to be a better person for someone out of love and selflessness.  My point is to make up your mind, actively find the help you need, and in the process try not to put yourself down too much, ok?I am not a professional.}}}

I’m even having trouble writing down what I’m feeling, because that means trying to grasp my thoughts, which seems impossible. Right now it feels like everything that can go wrong, will. I woke up this morning convinced that I have done some serious damage to my brain chemistry, because I’ve been smoking a lot of hash for the past few months. Another worry that is passing through my brain is: “I’m not going to attain to anything, because I can’t and won’t make use of my degree…so the rest of my life I’m going to be miserable and pointless. ”  But the main thought that is troubling me right now is actually a revisited worry. It’s the fear that not only that I’m gay, but also that I have feelings for my best friend. This thought originated when I first got depersonalization when I was 16, and it returns every so often.  We hung out last night, and we smoked which was a horrible idea. The whole time I was examining how I was feeling, and then panicked as I realized I was actually thinking before talking, and thinking about how I could be perceived…when she’s normally the only person I care 0% what she thinks of me. But I guess it is expected when I’m having these extremely uncomfortable thoughts that seem true.  Another fear related to this one has to do with another close friend, whom I actually have feelings for. He’s been one of my best friends for the past 2 years, long story short: we’re both in love with each other. He’s normally always on my mind, and last week I cried all day when I realized it couldn’t work out, but now I hardly feel any feelings for him…which may just be my anxiety…but it’s still making me panic. “What if I never had feelings for him? What if I’m incapable of feeling anything for anyone?” “What if I can’t attain an emotional connection with men?”At the moment I know what is happening, but I can’t seem to get out of these panic thought loops. I think this is a result from smoking, having too much free time to worry and probably the emotional stress from my friend whom I have feelings for. I think I need to start seeing my psychologist again. }}},{{{I'm not a doctor or a therapist, and I know you probably don't have the money or insurance to go see one, because I know it's expensive. But I know what you're going through. You may have "pure-o" OCD. Irrational thoughts coupled with anxiety and fear. There's a website to help you out that I used to frequent. It's called www.stuckinadoorway.orgPlease though, if you can, go see a therapist. The best things for this are a combo of medication+cognitive behavioral therapy. Best of luck, I know what your world feels like right now, but I can truly tell you that it will get better, but it takes time and a shit load of effort. But it's worth it.}}}

For example: a lazy person won't clean up the house; a depressed person won't clean, won't go shopping, won't go to a party, won't go to the park, won't visit with friends, etc.}}}

You just don't ever want to wake up because you don't want to face the hopelessness stuck in your head. Often depressed people don't want to die, because that is against human instinct. If depressed people could have it their way, they would be in a coma forever. This way they are not dead but they don't have to wake up and face the world. However, because that is not a realistic resolution, there is suicide, alcohol, prescribed drugs, or time (natural recovery). Lazyness on the otherhand, comes from lack of motivation. This can be associated to depression but is not at all the same thing. A person can be completely happy with their life and yet to find a motivation to be dedicated or have an impressive work ethic. For example, young people often have yet to find motivation because parents can handle finances and/or no one relies on them for anything. Individuals can be happy, just lazy.}}}

Laziness however is a term used to critise people that aren't seen to be pulling their weight. That's the real difference, perception. A lack of understanding and all too often a self-serving opportunity to inflate one's ego lends certain people the nerve to make that judgement call.

I guess my anxieties came in the way...Can anyone give me some advice!1 Comment Loading... }}},{{{You are right, the believing in yourself crap is garbage. the only times i became 'confident' is by falling on my face flat a few times. and by trying new things. thats it. i got really uncomfortable, went tongue tied, forgot my lines at auditions (as an actor), dropped icecubes out of my mouth while trying to form a sentence on a date, and the list goes on. YOu are gonna have to go try new things and trust me, those books wont teach you anything unless you just get out of your house and try new things. THEN maybe the books will make sense (after some application!) I understand for our knowledge you went in detail about all the things wrong with you, but i would love to see the list of things right with you. I am going to dissect your question now: I have issues communicating and am constantly self- conscious.Start with something very small in your life right now (something harmless) and speak up on it. "communication" is an intimidating subject, but if you break it down into bite sizes, it is managable. so start with small things, something safe. I dont know what environment you are in but for example, saying hello to a grocery store attendant. Most likely they are too busy to hold a full convo, so they will just be polite. Great practice for you. maybe saying good morning to a nice coworker (or whatever applies to you) or when you make a meaningless call to telemarketers/cable tv/bank etc, just communicating yourself to the best of your ability (write down beforehand what you want to say on the phone). The point of starting small is you will get a hang of it and INTERNALLY believe that it isnt that difficult. Notice not once did i use the scary words like 'confidence' 'self esteem'. I  shake uncontrollably and avoid most things which lead to embarrassment.  I am totally embarrassed of how my body looks like and feel incredibly  ugly and stupid. My social skills are undeveloped and I am slow minded  so I can't defend myself verbally if I need to. Funny thing: YOU ARE TOTALLY COMFORTABLE expressing yourself by writing on the internet. this is good news. you are not awkward, ugly (we cant even see you yay!), or stupid when you are on the internet! and we cant see you shake so now we cant see how ugly your body is! (i highly doubt its ugly, i am sure you like to exaggerate the details ;)...). Look, you sound very analytical (trust me, i can relate), and you are just naming all the things you hate about yourself. But maybe you have to open your eyes and see there are many awkward people who are embracing their 'awkwardness' rather than shutting it down. Your writing style is funny and honest. Resources:*go on youtube and watch MISADVENTURES OF AWKWARD BLACK GIRL*. this girl is making a Show for HBO now all because she embraced who she was rather than get rid of it. She was an outcast, and then her series from youtube got picked up because it was 'original'. She said kids in Compton said she talked 'too white' and she went to stanford, she always stood out. I hope you get my drift, being different isnt bad....just stop reading damn Cosmo advice columns or watching reality tv (now those women are the one who need real help)* Check out BRENE BROWN ted talk on vulnerability.*}}}

Can it be that you just cannot see for now any real challenge in front of you?Would the term "existential vacuum" describe your feeling better?If there is a chance that this is correct, then I would recommend this book: Man's Search for Meaning.

Try working on some projects that are personally meaningful to you; if you like singing, record a song; if you like painting; make a painting; etc. If you pick a topic you are highly interested in, I think you'll find that you become so engrossed in producing high quality work, that that becomes rewarding in and of itself, aside from any financial remuneration you might receive. Focus on being productive, rather than prosperous, and the latter will take care of itself (I believe!) That being said, ensure that you have enough to cover basic material considerations, while you work on your personal projects. Best wishes and good luck!}}}

Some people appreciate attention no matter the cause, and perhaps this fuels some sort of inherent drive in you. This may be especially true if your anxiety is caused by a perceived lack of self-importance. The panic attacks would make you feel important because people would appear to care.If that is not the case and you do miss the actual physical feeling, Liz Mullen is most likely correct. You probably miss the adrenaline and intense rush of feelings that come along with it. I will admit the feeling of a panic attack is one of the most intense things I've experienced, I suppose I could see how with a different mindset it might be addictive.}}}

I enjoy spending time with friends, meeting new people and having new experiences.My anxiety hates to do all of those things.My family found it hard to understand. "If you like going out so much, then how come you never do? If you love to interact with others, then why are you always so quiet and distant?"I think of my anxiety disorder as something external. It's not me. It's something else. A monster that resides in my head and makes it hard to do things like leave the house, make phone calls, and talk to strangers.There are also physical responses to anxiety. Trembling, hyperventilating, rapid heart beat, nausea, and uncontrollable terrible thoughts.And of course there are the dreaded panic attacks, moments when you feel you are literally going to die.After a while, anxiety makes it difficult to sleep. I am not usually a jealous person, but whenever I come across someone who can sleep easily I feel like strangling them. They don't know what they've got.Anxiety is also terribly frustrating. You want to be happy. You want to be at peace. But you just can't. It's unbearable. Eventually, you start to become depressed.And guess what? Anxiety causes insomnia which causes depression which causes anxiety which causes insomnia. Fun, right?But you know something?I could deal with all of that stuff. I could handle it.The worse part of having anxiety, in my opinion, is that it makes it next to impossible to enjoy yourself.Your favorite band is town! Are you going the concert? Nope.Your friends invited you out! What do you say? Umm…. No I can't, I have something else to do. (No, I don't. I never do.)Someone is interested in you and wants to get to know you better! I know! I'll never look them in the eye and be completely unable to keep up conversation until they give up and I feel like a failure! It's enough to make you give up on life.HOWEVER.It can get better. If you work hard and don't give up on yourself.Therapy can be very very helpful and is always recommended.Over the years I've mastered different breathing exercises and mantras that I repeat to myself whenever I'm feeling overwhelmed.I have a playlist on my iPod titled "DON'T PANIC" with all the songs that are most effective in warding off unwanted thoughts.I have an app that gives me daily advice, support and access to thousands of others all over the world who are dealing with the same things I am.I talk to people about my problems.It turns out my father also has also had an anxiety disorder and has decades of wisdom and advice to offer me.I'm far from through with anxiety, but I have made a lot of progress. I know how to recognize my anxiety and am taking steps every day to face the things that make me anxious. I haven't had a panic attack in over six months! (Hold the applause please.)I know I still have a long ways to go if I'm ever going to defeat the anxiety monster in my head, but I know that I can. And that's enough to get me through every day.}}}

I wish to address this before I become cynical and start acting out in a way I would regret like being manipulative of women.Should I seek some type of professional help? is so, then what type? }}},{{{I can sympathize with this. During my twenties, I had several years of being single and a couple relationships. I was often anxiety-ridden over things not working out. But what I have learned and continue to learn is that dating doesn't always turn out the way you'd like or expect.  I know that is a bit cliché, but I think if you really can learn to internalize that, it may help dissipate your anxiety. When I was single and going on a lot of dates, I worried that the guys wouldn't like me or just wanted to sleep with me. I thought if I were hotter, they would just want to be with me. What happened: some guys weren't into me, some did just want a "good time", others wanted more, and I ended up not being into them. I resented that hot dumb girls could land boyfriends without needing to be nice, funny or interesting. It didn't matter how mad or anxious I was about it.Then when I was in relationships, I worried that the relationship wouldn't last, that I wasn't a good enough girlfriend, etc. What happened: I was in a 2 year relationship in which I super nice to a guy who turned out to be married. I saw that females who were bossy, needy, demanding, cheaters were still landing the fiancées.  I thought is this who I am supposed to be if I want a relationship? It just didn't resonate who me. Maybe I am misinterpreting your comments, but it sounds like a key source of your anxiety is that you're not sure about how you're "supposed to" behave on dates to make them work out. Well, here's the real kicker, even if the date goes well and you keep dating, meet her friends, get engaged, get hitched...there's no 100% guarantee that it will be happily ever after. So be whoever you are - and then find someone who appreciates exactly that. I think that is the only way you will enjoy yourself along this whole journey.One of my good guy friends just started dating a GREAT girl last December. We spent our twenties bitching to each other about our dating anxieties. He can be a little socially awkward, but a nice guy, decent looking enough, fit, smart, good job etc. He REALLY wanted a gf, was on at least 2 dating sites, and very social. Yet, a good relationship just never happened until pretty recently. I think this was one of few times he didn't ask me for dating advice and just went with his gut, was totally himself. I hate to admit it but our group of friends was slightly surprised (and overjoyed) that he met a girl who didn't mind his "weirdness". He's going to be 35, and is about to move in with this girl who is really sweet and loves him.I don't know what makes you awesome, but there's no reason to be nervous about who you are. Someone will adore you for it, even if it takes time.}}}

First off, I'm not really convinced that a spark always comes all that quickly, and hoping or searching for one can really prevent you from enjoying what's in front of you.Second, you tend to define yourself by a bunch of numbers, rating yourself on things like looks, humor, intelligence etc. I think you're probably more than that. There are probably a lot of other things that make you you. When you describe yourself in Quora questions, I realize you may not always have enough space to put down your uniqueness. However, I do get the sense that you are reducing yourself to sliding scales, and I think you're probably more than that. I'm guessing you may think of yourself in that way. So, definitely figure out what makes you unique and when you talk about yourself, be yourself in the sense that you are giving yourself credit and don't reduce yourself to a series of sliding scales on looks, intelligence etc. This type of internal confidence and self-knowledge will both make you more selective when dating and more attractive to people whom you date.Third, a lot of anxiety results in feedback loops. We get anxious about things and that anxiety only makes things worse which prevents us from being in the moment, reducing our odds of achieving whatever goal we seek out to achieve. That then makes us more anxious about our ability to achieve our goal. Because of all that, it makes sense to think about how your mindset needs to change to reduce that anxiety.Forth, recognize that being single is a frigging blast. It's fun. You get to go on dates with a ton of different people. You get to try things out. The world is pretty great. If you can get yourself to saddle up to that mindset, all of a sudden, you'll be having fun with a lot of people. In other words, if you can change the way you think about things and realize that you can have fun dating and start to value that more, other things will fall into place. In that scenario, you're not in any sort of pressure to get into a relationship. Gradually you'll end up spending more time with some people than others, and you may even get to the point where you feel guilty about seeing other people despite wanting to. At that point, when you no longer feel like seeing other people, get into a relationship, but not before. In other words, your goal is not to get into a relationship as much as it is to live your life and embrace the moments that come your way. By putting too much pressure on yourself to get into a relationship, you're hurting your interactions with people because you will be less able to enjoy the moment with them. And you should enjoy that moment with them because life is frigging great. If you can really dwell on this idea that you're only hurting yourself by putting too much pressure on yourself and not enjoying dating more, then you will actually be more effective at achieving your goal of getting a relationship — and ironically you will actually be trying less hard to achieve that goal.Beyond that, in the course of going out with a lot of people, you'll get to know yourself and how you interact with a lot of different people. You'll be able to better define yourself beyond sliders. If you simply have fun with people with reduced expectations, you'll get that better feel for yourself because you'll be able to see yourself through how you reacted in all these different situations vs seeing yourself via sliders. So, if you look at dating as this process of self discovery, fun and experiences, then all of a sudden things open up and dating actually becomes a productive and valuable life experience, something fun that you can remember, a situation where there's no need to rush, and where that reduced pressure actually increases the odds of relationships forming.}}}

Your description of yourself makes you, certainly, attractive enough to have a girlfriend.The one thing a woman may find unattractive is your admitted anxiety about not being in a relationship. Put yourself in their shoes. How would you feel about a woman who just wants to get married? She doesn't necessarily want to marry you, but you will do, because you meet all of her qualifications.I think you are brave to put this question up on quora, even anonymously. You may want to talk to someone about why you have so much anxiety about this issue.Good luck.}}}

Here:"I see men that are disrespectful, less attractive, liars, barely making ends meet, etc. And many of them are with really sweet women."Amazing.The secret is (straight but true):Don't give a shit so much. You are over-thinking EEEEVRYTHING (thats because you are smart). I did that all the time, in fact that what caused me to lose my previous girl.So:1) Stop giving a shit, if you are not having "fun" if there is no spark - say it, or start doing something YOU enjoy! I am not saying "be less respectful to your partner" - no! But make SURE the priority is you. Because if you will enjoy yourself more - you will be less depressed, and thus more fun to a girl (and thats what she enjoys more).2) Don't think of tomorrow live your life TODAY. That will also help you enjoy the moments more.3) Professional help?! Dude are you kidding me? This is totally normal for smart people, to go through whatever you described right now - you are completely fine. Seriously, dear US citizens, just because you have some MINOR problems in life, doesn't mean you need to seek professional help (again - over thinking).Just RELAX, and start enjoying what you like in life. Believe me there is nothing "rocket science" in that.}}}

And all the pushing that you're doing is backfiring and manifests itself in an anxiety and misunderstanding of the point of dating.You sound as a reasonable person with a "mildly funny" sense of humor (as you have described), so the question is, "Why are you dating?"No, I am not picking on you, I am just asking about the reason to subject yourself to dating frequency of "1-3 dates per week" when you appear to be comfortable without it.Let's be honest here: the stress of dealing with unresponsive dates, dates with baggage and other emotional issues where a certain "spark" is being blamed for the date gone wrong, which puts the outcome of the date completely out of your control.I suggest - and bear with me here - that you put this dating on hold for awhile.Let's say you will take a temporary hiatus of 1 month: no dates at all.You can still talk to other females, and develop friendships with them, and you can even flirt with them but hold off on the dates until your mind has been detoxed from all the previous experiences.If you think about it, the nervousness about the past dates which are no longer in the present moment, thus making them irrelevant as past experience does not guarantee future performance - is exactly what's causing you not to enjoy the present moment.Your mind still races to the past - for understandable reasons - so it's best to give your mind a rest.Your worth as a human being is not counted in the number of dates (averaging 2 per week, times 52 weeks puts you within the "playboy" status).Furthermore, you need to treat your personal time as valuable as your business time: each time you are with someone, you need to share with them an emotional part of you in order to see if you can connect. Thus, by meeting too many people, you basically over-spending yourself emotionally without any return at all, which further causes a turmoil because emotional self takes longer to heal/replenish itself.So you should only approach a person (a lady, in your case) when you are sure that you have met your match: if it takes a week or a year to get to know that person, do it - but without too much of an emotional spending, so develop a friendship first, then see if this person is truly worthy of your time.You need to develop a more discriminating taste (not discriminatory though), and make a list of everything that a girl needs to possess in order to score a date with you: just a pulse and a willingness to have a free meal doesn't cut it.}}}

I'm in the same boat as you, what helps is not going on dates period and putting yourself in situations where you get to know each other naturally. that's why so many people fall for each other at work. when your doing what you love or something that's interesting your personality just shines and your not worrying about anything except how good of a time or focused you are, you get to interact with people when it's unforced. good luck}}}

I just can't keep my hands off of him.  See how that works?  Same great guy + 2 different smells = 2 TOTALLY DIFFERENT OUTCOMES!  It may seem trivial but - for me anyway - a good smell is the difference between sex and no sex, and physical intimacy (the want of it, the getting of it, and the enjoying of it ) is a definite deal-breaker, relationship-wise.  So there's my $0.02, since you asked. Good luck to you. :-)Cheers,Mari b}}}

Honestly, I'd even feel flattered if someone invaded my personal space...E.g. here's a good quote:She may have been being nice. One of my students sent me a message on facebook and the situation was such that it actually was appropriate. However, outside of this one specific case, I would probably rip a students head off for doing that. Facebook is personal to a vast majority of people and just deciding to message them one day would be akin to looking up their home phone number and just giving them a call out of the blue. }}},{{{I don't find your example to be an invasion of personal space! I can agree with you on that. Now if the student had been posting a link to their teachers Facebook page on their own wall this I would consider an invasion of personal space.I have a personal example of invasion of personal space that would serve as a better example.In 2008 during the recession I lost my job and my house and moved back home to live with my father and stepmother. Shortly after moving in my niece came to Canada from the United States to visit for a month. My stepmother made it very clear to me that I was not allowed in my nieces room and that I was to respect her personal space and privacy. I found her behaviour in this conversation to be very offensive as to the implication of my intentions that she was making were completely unfounded. Never the less I respected her wishes.During this time I got a part time job and started back at school. One day I came home from work and went into my room and found the mess that was my room had been cleaned... I found certain items were missing from my room (books, movies, clothes and at one time even money). My family are bible thumpers and most of what was missing from my room they might have deemed offensive to their religious beliefs. My book collection was comprised of philosophical literature from the likes of Plato and Socrates to Sumerian, Babylonian, Persian, Phoenician, Egyptian and Greek corpus texts.Was I angry? I'm very slow to anger I was very disillusioned. My personal space had been invaded, some of my most personal possessions had been thrown out. I sat there in my room for quite a while thinking about why this was done to me. Did my stepmother hate me I wondered. This was a complete hypocrisy of what she told me of respecting other people's personal space and privacy, I thought that applied to everyone but apparently it only applied to me. For being a Christian she seemed to have a real fork tongue, nothing she said held any meaning it was all a lie used to manipulate me to doing her biding. My father eventually came to talk to me. I could see in his eyes that he had nothing to do with what had happened. His eyes roamed the room, unable to make eye contact with me. I knew he was being used as my stepmothers scapegoat, I felt sorry for my father to be put in such a position as he had been at work and had nothing to do with my stepmothers actions. After that day I had no trust for anything my stepmother had to say. I always had to wonder if it was a lie or if she was trying to manipulate me. This is the outcome of when someone invades your personal space, trust, respect, loyalty and honour are destroyed and a simple apology does not undo what has been done.}}}

It's always intended to distract from some serious abuses by the ruling elite in the country.Pardon my Greek, improvements welcome.Anonymous is correct, there should be a word for fear of nationalism and fear of fear used for nationalism. And we should all have it. I was warning about this problem decades ago.In my first inaugural address I explained about "my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is...fear itself — nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance."I thought I was getting through but the people of the United States and the world are still easily manipulated by fear.

What would you advise me? }}},{{{Your story sounds familiar, except that I completed high school a semester early and left education, first because I didn't have the energy to care and later on to focus on fixing my own circuitry.Now I'm recently 23 years old, no inkling of any future depression, and I can mindfully tap hypomania as long as I rest afterwards. The secret? Developing a perspective on my perspective. I now have a stable view transcendent to my unstable one, so I can account and compensate for the warping of strange base perspective.How? A lot of really intense self-exploration, not allowing me to hide from myself no matter how it sucked to look at myself. Now, I've rearranged and I love myself.In fact, I have motivations to go back to school.Actually, I want to go back so that I can get a societal permission slip to go to work reinventing the educational system.Final answer: Focus on you for now. Get yourself straight. You'll be glad you did.}}}

What followed for almost two years was anxiety attacks and the sensation of my chest deep inside being on fire at random times that lasted around five minutes. I was told by an ER Physician that the toxins from the spider can remain in your system for about three years. Whether that's true or not, I don't know. Mine lasted around two years though. I was also told that once your bit, other Brown Recluse spiders will be attracted to you and bite you more which did happen. They would crawl towards me like I was a gravatational pull. I was bit many more times because of this and I wear the scars to prove it. The other bites did not cause anxiety, nausea, or the burning sensation in my chest. I guess my body adapted.

All of my social anxiety is based off of my relations with other people; the more I care about what the other person thinks of me, the more anxious I become. I figure there's a point in a relationship with someone where I start to trust that they'll continue to enjoy my company even if I do something stupid, but in reality these instances are few and far between, so these rules remain mostly intact:If I like someone, and enjoy their company, I obsess over whether they enjoy mine.I choose my words carefully. Any mistake, my anxiety tells me, could ruin a relationship forever.In the case of a social hierarchy (such as in a classroom environment) wherein I'm obligated to respect a superior (in this case, a teacher), I am naturally inclined to obsess over their opinion of me. In rare instances, I dislike a superior to the extent that this obsession wanes; this has only happened to me twice.If a relationship becomes distant, but has not yet truly staled, I will be compelled to avoid interaction. Letting a friendship die while we're still on good terms is a lot more appealing than inadvertently ruining it.If I have progressed to a point in a friendship where a friend will actively seek me for personal advice, I will listen and sympathize, but offer few legitimate solutions. I hate situations where I might complicate someone's life with greater consequences than just mutual hate.I don't think that any of these are truly based in fear. I don't have trouble communicating people because I fear something could happen to me; my anxiety stems from a fear of emotionally hurting others. Being a social person, though, can complicate things.For example, several times in my childhood I have attempted to completely break off social ties. I realized the source of my anxiety, and tried to eliminate it entirely. I longed to become The Quiet Kid, the vaguely lonely-looking child in the corner that no one ever quite seems to start conversations with. This wasn't me just trying to be "cool"; it was me trying to avoid the consequences of social relationships. Everything dies eventually, and even the best of friendships somehow seem to end in tears. Being The Quiet Kid seemed like the most practical solution.Of course, all of these attempts died within a matter of days, and I came to regret them. I didn't come to regret them because of how they affected me, personally; instead, I regretted these attempts because it made my existing friends feel like I didn't care about them. Are these assumptions vain? Absolutely. Is it narcissistic for me to assume that anyone could ever be devastated just because of how I act around them? Probably. Still, the possibility remains, and my anxiety reigns supreme. Self-consciousness, it tells me, is the ultimate solution to maintaining healthy relationships.Recently, I've come to realize this isn't true. I've somehow forgotten how it feels to express my genuine opinions to people, out of fear that I'd hurt them. Sure, it would probably affect me in the long run, but that's not what keeps me awake at night. When I'm having an anxiety attack, it's not because I'm afraid someone will tell me a nasty word, or two; it's because the relationship might no longer feel mutual. I'd hate for any relationship to become artificial; rather, I'd hate for someone to feel compelled to feign friendliness for my sake alone.--Just after typing this, I realized how desperate I sound to rationalize myself, and I hope this isn't taken "the wrong way". I'm not trying to make myself sound good by writing any of this; I'm just trying to answer the question as best as I can. In reality, I don't think it really matters where anxiety comes from. It makes us all do things we regret, regardless.For example, I was once in a purely artificial relationship after a disagreement with a friend over a personal subject. After I realized my opinion conflicted with hers, I completely withdrew. Following one of the most anxious conversations of my life, I shut down, and asked that she never mentioned the incident again. The one thing on my mind was how she'd view me in the future. I didn't care about the argument anymore. I had absolutely no motivation to argue. I proposed the issue be laid to rest, and she agreed. According to my anxiety, it was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made.For years afterward, the friend would refer to the matter we'd disagreed on, promoting her own beliefs, and happily crushing those I had once been proud to consider mine. At first, I thought this was somehow a coincidence, but the consistency of her efforts seemed to prove otherwise. She was clearly doing this to spite me, but I had no energy to do anything other than hold my tongue. No matter how offensive I personally thought her arguments were, I didn't want to do anything about it. I had no motivation to stand up for myself, or for other people. It was stupid, I figured. It wasn't worth it. The issue would resolve itself. She finally did stop talking about it, and I believed it was over. Predictably, though, it wasn't. I no longer enjoyed her company. It was no longer mutual, but this time I was the offender. When my breaking point came, I deliberately terminated the relationship. It was better that way, I thought. She no longer had to endure the company of a fake friend.I regret the decision every day. I fear that, because of my inability to communicate my emotions, that she has no idea what she did wrong. I fear that my anxiety amplified everything she's ever said to me, and that the majority of our conflict was all in my head. It's not about what she thinks about me (I already know the extent of her bitterness); instead, it's about how the event affected her. I honestly feel somewhat relieved that she doesn't talk to me anymore, but the thought that I'd hurt her without her knowing why has tormented me for years.--My social anxiety has components of both fear and "love" (be it in terms of sympathy, affection, respect, or what have you), and I'm reluctant to place one above the other, because the two are far from mutually exclusive. Whatever the case, it sucks.}}}

First off, know that I am not special - if I can get through it, so can you. This knowledge alone can take a giant weight off of your shoulders; just knowing that it is possible to get up off the floor. I know (all too well) that feeling of the endless loop of negativity. The one where you just expect bad things to happen, and feel like it will never end. It feels unbearable to deal with. Even when you do get an idea or burst of energy, your mind can talk you out of it, and tell you it won't work out. It's like being a prisoner to your own mind. Meditation doesn't help. Going to new places doesn't help. It feels like there's no escape.I remember having thoughts that I wanted to die. But really, I had a pretty strong feeling deep down that would not make things any better at all. This goes deep into philosophy and spirituality, which can be rather subjective; but at the very core of life, I just didn't believe that this universe was designed in a way which I would be rewarded with happiness and good things for taking my own life. There was no evidence to me that things would get any better with this method.So I eventually realized I was stuck. There was no escape from my negative thoughts. What then?I stopped caring. I let the negative thoughts be. I learned to accept everything. So what if I never amount to anything? So what if I never get married, or have kids, or accomplish something great in life, or achieve any of the thousands of other fabricated stories that I or others expected of me? What if none of that mattered? What if I didn't care what other people thought of me? What if I was just happy to be a person with a negative brain who doesn't do shit? Could I accept that? I'd have done anything to not have to deal with the pressure I had put on myself. So I lowered all of the expectations I had on myself. Completely. I let go.I realized none of it mattered. It was all stuff I put on myself. And as soon as I no longer felt like I needed to be superhuman in some way, I was liberated from the pressure and negativity that was telling me I was underachieving in life. What happens if you reverse your expectations? What if you didn't need to accomplish or achieve anything other than to just exist?Reading through your question, I see a lot of myself in there. I see things I've thought. I remember being in that place, and I remember thinking the sky was falling. But the thing is - when the mind is in a depressed state, it gets tunnel vision. It can only see a bad scenario, and it's not until later on looking back that it can understand how many other options there actually were.This may or may not work for you the same way it worked for me. But I'll throw it out there.An insight I have is that much of what you are talking about revolves around external validation (feeling socially anxious, feeling unconfident, scared of rejection). Hypothetically, what if you completely removed your desire to be accepted by others, to be confident, and to be a social butterfly? What if you could be happy to just be a quiet, reserved, humble person, and be satisfied with that?The irony in all of this is that the mind can cause you to suffer so much that you stop caring about the external rewards that used to be so important (shallow acceptance, being "cool", being rich, being popular, being a moviestar, whatever desire we thought was so important to our happiness and wellbeing).When this happens, when the desire is gone, when you truly realize that none of it matters, that is when you become free to do anything you want to do. I've experienced it. Since then, I've been able to do things that blow me away. But I never get thrown off balance. Because all of the good things in my life don't define me. I enjoy them for what they are, without being attached to them. If they go away, I am okay with that. I know that I've lived through the horror of being a prisoner to my own mind, and made it out much stronger. This gives me faith that if I lost everything again, I could handle it.At my darkest moments, the thing that turned everything around for me was this insight: "If life is a process of unpredictable suffering, and trying to run away from it makes it worse, what if I embraced it? Is suffering really suffering if I enjoy it? What if I enjoyed the impermanence? What if I harnessed my self-discipline to suffer more than I've ever suffered in the quest to do something I never thought I'd be able to do before? If I can't get rid of my suffering, if there's no hope of me ever being happy again, if I don't care about being judged, what an amazing opportunity I have right now to put all my energy towards making some other people happy. Then the suffering will have a true meaning, which is much better than what I was doing before: suffering without purpose."Through this mentality, as time went by, I slowly but surely found myself becoming more and more satisfied with life. I gave up trying to be happy, and focused completely on utilizing my life to serve others. And by some miracle, it made me happy again. It helped me find my balance and rediscover the joy of living. For the first time, I was able to finally understand what it means to love myself for who I really am, and to validate myself rather than needing others to do it for me. Who'd have thought?Lastly, being able to answer this question for you actually makes me happy that I went through all of it, because now I constantly come across people who can learn from my experiences. Someday, you may look back on this as a blessing in disguise. If you can handle this, you will be mentally tough enough to handle anything life throws at you.--I'm biased, but I sincerely believe this blog will change your life for the better.ⒷⓁⓄⒼ ☞ Follow Uncommon Sense for 21st Century Living on Quora ☜}}}

I know this is more easily said than done. Don't give up:Every moment when you are aware of fear increasing, breathe out your fear, breathe in peace -- and be as aware of what you are feeling in every moment. That is, check in with your Self often. Depending on what you're going through, it can be as often as every two minutes. Some people live harrowing lives. You can set an alarm and check in automatically, or train yourself to do it regularly or whenever something 'triggers' feelings you do not want.Using the hack for Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), chart your feelings every morning and every night whenever you are feeling distress. You can get a Skills Training Workbook -- the best in the market, in my opinion. Here is the link: http://www.amazon.com/Training-T... and, even though author Dr. Marsha Linehan formulated this workbook for women with borderline personality disorder, the workbook is suitable for anyone going through a difficult time needing CBT and provides those who implement its systems with more cognitive awareness, hacks and memes to create the change they wish to have in their lives.You will see that your feelings change over time because you will have graphs, reminders and all kinds of help in this workbook.Self-help and using such a workbook can be less expensive and at times more helpful than face to face therapy when there is a mismatch of therapist to client/patient (although finding the right match is very necessary and even critical at times, too. Don't ever give up finding the right therapist. Interview at least five before settling on one). You will find the right balance of self-help and therapy that works for you.Good luck!}}}

An antidepressant would help with the following problems that you cited above:socially anxietylack of confidencefear of rejectionability to stay positivefeelings of hopelessness, or as you say "like it's a dead-end" and it's not "never really going to get better."sadness or as you say "crying almost everyday."feeling "ok" - you say you are tired of "trying to be okay."For some additional background information see : Will Wister's answer to What are some pills that make a person more confident?The stress from the fear of rejection is a secondary problem which would be ameliorated if the fear of rejection was reduced.It's actually common that people who are depressed self-medicate with alcohol, so you won't need to do that as often.I'm glad that you've tried herbal remedies as it's akin to admitting  you have a problem, but studies show that pharmaceutical antidepressants are much more effective.So you'd need to start seeing a psychiatrist in addition to your therapist, and a psychiatrist could help you decide whether on not to get on a prescription for antidepressants.In your case, it sounds like the first drug to try would likely be an SSRI - so that means Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, or Celexa.Remember think of an antidepressant like a temporary boost to turbo-charge your therapy. You can always get off of it later if it proves ineffective - or if you get to be so well that you simply don't need it anymore.I can tell that a number of people who I know had symptoms like yours derived substantial benefits from an antidepressant.Your psychiatrist will also be another person to whom you can tell your problems.Also, I would advise you to amp up your therapy. Once a month for therapy for problems of your sort is not enough. I would suggest once a week if you can do it - so that you get better faster.It seems like you have a lot to talk about, so much so that you're afraid to tell your friends or as you say "I'm scared they're going to run away from me. "  Given that, it makes sense to engage a therapist more regularly so that you can unload.CBT or cognitive behavioral therapy is extremely effective. It helps you understand why you think about some problems in one way and helps you to know when your thinking unfairly steers you in a negative direction. Make sure you have a therapist who is familiar with CBT and can help you better understand your own thinking.For example, if someone is short with you, the interpretation could be that they don't like you or that they are busy. People with biases unfairly assume the more negative possibility when they should understand that a range of things are possible. There are all sorts of patterns in thinking.With respect to social anxiety, there are a variety of thinking patterns and behaviors that can also be modified to help improve your happiness.Therapy is a big deal, and pills are just booster. It's important to understand why you're thinking the way you're thinking so that you can have a healthier, happier life.}}}

Some people are blessed with the ability to hide it better than others, but no one feels at ease in new situations or groups of strangers. Recognize that everyone is in the same boat. Everybody is scared of rejection. Rightly so! Rejection hurts. But there's something much worse than rejection: not trying. It's easy to shy away from risk-taking; by not going for it, you're preemptively failing, which gives you a feeling of control. But it's a superficial feeling and it masks a really big problem. The best way out is to get yourself rejected, often. After the first couple of times, when you fail to die from embarassment or suffer total ostracization, rejection won't seem so scary, and then will just start to seem like a routine part of life -- unpleasant, but not enormous and terrifying. As my friend Kimberly says: you've got to kiss a lot of frogs. That's true socially, romantically, professionally, creatively. Get out there and start kissing!You shouldn't have to face your fears on your own. Show vulnerability to your friends. It shows maturity and a deeper confidence. They'll probably be more willing to open up to you and to trust you. Being openly vulnerable is a much stronger position than fake confidence. Then you'll be facing school and life with a team of allies. It helps a ton.Shrinks can't do the work for you. They can show you the door, but only you can walk through it. They can help you analyze and understand your behavior, but only you can change it. It's your responsibility to own your inner life.You don't have to be okay. Plenty of high-functioning people in this world cry every day. You don't want to be crying all the time, but it's perfectly fine to feel depressed and anxious. The world is a terrible place! You'd have to be an idiot not to get down about it. But the world is also a beautiful place. Let the sadness and anxiety come, recognize it, validate it, and then let it pass. You're doing the right thing about alcohol. It's perfectly normal to find social situations hard without alcohol -- that's why everyone else is drinking. You're wise to recognize that it's a poor substitute for genuinely feeling at ease. Don't punish yourself; as long as you're not a problem drinker or dependent, having a few beers at a party is harmless. Don't drink alone, though, and don't get wasted. Look for other ways to make parties tolerable. Introverted nerds like me tend to go in for DJing, which is a good way to be part of the party without having to be too social. I don't know about "medicine made of plants." Most herbal remedies operate by the placebo effect, which, if it works, terrific. Unless we're talking about a euphemism for pot, in which case, the same cautions you use for alcohol apply.Thinking alone in your head is not enough to get better. If it was, no one would be unhappy! Involve other people. Whether it's your friends, your family, trusted teachers, religious leaders, or your shrink, you shouldn't be expected to face depression and anxiety alone. The good news is that your experience puts you in a good position to empathize with other depressed and anxious people. You'd be surprised how many happy-seeming people are going through similar stuff. Give support and attention, and people will eagerly return the favor. Some people are judgmental jerks who will cut you off, but you're better off without them. Look for the mature and serious people, especially those older than you. They'll do you right.Suicidal thoughts are very serious. Talk to someone about them. Don't be ashamed. This is yet another one that's more ordinary than you'd think. No one wants you to hurt yourself.The good news is that it's really hard to be 19. You're still in the tail end of adolescence, which is the most miserable part of life. I was totally confused, clueless, anxious and miserable at 19. Each passing year I acquire more wisdom, more experience, more insight, more compassion. Like they say to the gay kids, It Gets Better. Hang in.}}}

They are judging you and indicating just how inadequate and worthless you really are. That is what is going on in your head and because of your previous experiences, you see it as a truth. They are confirming what you already believe. Seeing what you think is true, is a way to get security.  When you say emotionally weak, if you look at it, you will see you are actually emotionally strong. That is, your emotions are really in charge and taking over. Your rationality can’t get a word in edgewise. You give yourself the logical reasonable information but it has no impact because emotions are really running things. You are ashamed of yourself which means someone didn’t get you jump-started properly and now you are on your own, still looking for a jump. There are people out there looking for people like you to join their cult. “I’ll give anything to belong.” Now you would like to move up the emotional scale to gratification, to get happy; and affiliation, to get secure. You are stuck in disgust, which is worthless; and Fear which is afraid, then bottomed out with sadness/loss, which is despair. As others have posted on this issue, there are a number of perfectly workable therapies which work for people as they themselves will attest. Most people set up processes which work from the outside, in. That is; you practice pushing a boundary until you get comfortable in the new place. It is a time proven method. The old phrase is the “Have-Do-Be” system.  One of the things I have to do with new patients is sort through my “Bag of tricks” to find ones most likely to work with given personalities. With things at the level of anxiety you are describing, I prefer to work from the inside, out. That is; change the belief system about yourself first, and then learn the techniques to make it work for you. “Be-Do-Have” system.The shame of "not good enough" I wrote about on another post.Mike Leary's answer to What are some ways to deal with shame?There are other dynamics which can work effectively too. I will go through one of those with you. This is a simplistic look at a complex process.The following is one of the early NLP processes. "Six step Reframing". You can look on YouTube for examples of therapist using it. It has been modified many times now, but the core is similar. Again this is only one of many formats for effective change in a short time. You can have a friend read this to you to help. If you're willing, you can even have your therapist do it, though they may already know an aspect of it and not utilized it. It generally is difficult to get into much trouble with this process. It is one of the safer mental processes to go through. The basic steps are all over the internet with NLP guidelines. This is described very well in Connirae and Steve Andreas book "Heart of the Mind"One of the beauties of this system is a basic presumption every drive in you has a your goodwill in mind. Each aspect is trying to help you to be okay. Even the ones, at first glance, which seem not to be. This in itself can be a stumbling block for some people, particularly if they have been trained in the polarizing views of certain religions of good and evil. It is accessing a subconscious part in most people.ReframingSit relaxed in a comfortable, quiet spot, with your arms at your side, palms up. Close your eyes so you can look at the inner pictures or not be distracted by externals. A lot of times it helps if you actually voice the statements out-loud as if you are talking to a person across from you.Identify the problem or issue that seems to be plaguing or bothering you, you've decide you want changed.Remember a time in your life when it has been a problem.Feel where the flinch it is stongest in your body, as...

I know that's hard, but it may really help to truly accept that a) this is how you feel right now -- it just is -- and b) that many others feel and have felt this way and have gotten through it.I don't mean that you should give up -- not at all. Just because you feel this way now doesn't mean you always will (though I'm sure it feels like it sometimes). But you need to not beat yourself up or feel ashamed about how you feel. We feel things for all sorts of reasons; those reasons may be "real" or "imaginary" but while you're feeling them it really doesn't matter -- the feelings are real and are what you have to deal with. At the same time, you need to not wallow in these feelings, allowing yourself to stay in this state day after day. Oddly enough, even the worst feelings can become attractive just by familiarity.Okay, second, realize that you may well be feeling this way because of two opposing forces inside you: on one hand, you want to change some aspect of your life. On the other, enacting that change is painful and/or terrifying. This tension is what's causing you to feel so down. (There are many other reasons of course, such as a major unaddressed trauma in your life, but that's less common and ultimately comes to the same thing -- a desire to change and a fear of change.)I say this because, if you didn't want to change, if you were really happy with the way things are, you wouldn't have any distress at your current situation. This discomfort may be about something entirely inside you (being more outgoing, standing up for what you believe, righting something in the past that you did -- it can be all sorts of things), or in relation to your family, a boy/girl friend, etc.. And if the change some part of you wants to make wasn't scary in some way, you would have done it already.  Finally, if there was something outside of you keeping you from making this change, you'd likely be more angry than depressed, as someone else would be preventing you from doing what you really want. Often, deep unhappiness is the result of this sort of internal conflict. A truism about how we live our lives is that no matter what odd, inexplicable, or seemingly destructive thing someone does, they're doing it because doing anything else is scarier and/or more painful. So, understand that this is something you can change... but that change will always seem harder than just being unhappy. You need to figure out what it is, as precisely and deeply as possible, that you want to change, why, and what about that makes you afraid. You mentioned fear of rejection -- that's a common and tough one. We all want to be loved, and to be accepted by a group that we can call "our people." But gaining that acceptance from others first requires a certain amount of confidence and openness on your part. The reason for this is that no one wants to be rejected, and everyone is, at some level, afraid that this new person might reject them too... so if you want to be accepted, you need to first be accepting, and that means being open to someone else rejecting you (which they may, if only to test whether you're going reject them back -- this is a common and very unfortunate cycle many people put themselves through, especially when they really crave acceptance from others). Now, it may be that your fear of rejection is really riding on top of something else -- only you can say for sure. That's why going through your feelings and understanding as precisely as you can what it is that you want and what it is that you're afraid of is so vitally important -- not just generally like "not being accepted" but specifically like, "I'm afraid my parents will reject me" or "I don't think I could be loved because of something I did" or something else entirely.  In doing so, you will very likely find that part of your life that causes you the most pain, the thing you most do not want to face, that you will do almost anything else (including being miserable) rather than having to face it. Once you find that thing, you have to decide whether it's worth overcoming it -- this process is where a psychologist can help (unfortunately, they can only go at a rate you're comfortable with, so if they don't challenge you, you can spin your wheels in "therapy" forever, getting nowhere). Once you understand this part of your life that you're dissatisfied with, you can begin taking steps to change it. You'll find that even very small steps really help, and really feel good. In advance, they'll look scary, sure to fail, etc. And you may even set yourself up to fail if you're not careful, by taking a step that's so huge that you're sure to fail. For example, you might erroneously say to yourself, "I feel like I'm too fat, so to confront it I'll run a marathon!" That way when you fail at the marathon, you can comfort yourself by saying "see, I am too fat and nothing I can do will stop that" -- rather than taking a small action like not having french fries (or just not finishing an order of french fries) that will put you on the difficult but rewarding road to working out whatever it is in your life that's making you so miserable.(Whew.

The only thing I'd like to add is advice my mother gave me concerning how to think about depression and anxiety (since I've suffered from it since the age of 13 and now I am nearly 26), here goes:Sometimes the mind needs a rest. Improving social skills is good, but when one feels weak, don't put more weight on your shoulders that you can bear. When you feel stronger, and feel comfortable and confident in the stronger feeling, then that might be the time to work on social skills or the like. Life is hard, but don't make it harder than it has to.Best wishes.}}}

You'll begin to identify with the witness, rather than the mind, and that's altogether more peaceful.You're welcome to PM me if you think I can help in any way.____________See also What are some best practices for meditation?,  Is it possible to learn meditation on your own?, and this answer to a similar question.}}}

But what is confidence? I look at it this way. Confidence is the awareness of one's existence, and being able to understand one's self, how s/he works, and doesn't work.I wasn't that confident either. I felt the same way you probably felt because I was nearly one year behind everyone in school so I was smaller than everyone else. I constantly felt criticized, thinking everyone is evaluating me at all times. But it turns out, I was the only on evaluating myself. It took me a while to realize that no one actually cares about me. Sounds terrible but this thought made me feel awesome. Think about it. No one cares about you. Is it really all that bad? No. This is statement has more positive implications than you probably think. No one cares about you simply means that no one cares about your mistakes (by no one, I mean strangers). In today's world, you can wear whatever you want, speak however you want to speak, and do whatever it is you want to do. Who cares what others think because they don't matter. Like I said, it took me a while to realize this, so I hope you take this into consideration and actually implement it into your life. Who care? Screw them all. Going back to my definition of confidence, understand yourself. Evaluate yourself as I have constantly evaluated myself, knowing that no one cares but you. Do not be caged by the judgements you think people are making of you. Don't think in terms of positive or negative. Think in terms of reality. Think in terms of truth, not only of the world, but of yourself as well. And since when was life a dead end? Life is no end. Life is no beginning. Life is now. It sounds like you might be missing the past. That's what was the case with me. I miss my past so much it's pathetic. Don't try to empty these thoughts. Embrace them. Think of it this way. Is a thought real? Thoughts are absolutely real. They are real because they are an extension of your consciousness. To not think thoughts is to cease truly existing. These happy thoughts are real. They are inside you. These happy thoughts will never leave you and will always be a part of who you are, no matter where or when you are. Take these real thoughts, and move on. Make these thoughts your motivation, and a part of your vision for the future.So like I said, to wrap things all up, aim for confidence. Aim to understand yourself. Start by looking at the world through the eyes of reality. Thoughts are real. Happy thoughts of your past will always be a part of you, but it's time to move on. If you only have only bad memories, it only goes up from here. But it is time to move on. Be confident. Be you. Look back at the past, and ahead into the future, but live in the present. I have a feeling you are lonely. Here is a quote from one of my favorite role models, the Dragon, Bruce Lee."Loneliness is only an opportunity to cut adrift and find yourself. In solitude you are least alone."Hope I helped. Comment on how you're doing. I do care.}}}

Emotional resilience feels just like being "emotionally stronger" but with even more oomph! Having a trusted friend on whom you can rely and be totally honest and vulnerable with to divulge your life situation is helpful. An appropriate friend would be someone who not only listens, but empowers you and never contributes to your feelings of helplessness. There are many cognitve behavioral therapy techniques that would help to reset a lot of the destructive patterns and negative self-messages that are being  reinforced. But beyond that, a humanist approach recognizes that your problem is not so unique; all of your issues stem from fear. I can offer you some solace, I hope, right NOW. What among your issues is happening right now? Before I address this "NOW" question further, let me be clear about positive thinking. Positive thinking is a dangerous part of our thinking. A daughter looks painfully and nervously at her mother before an important tryout and says "but what if I don't get the part? I'll lose my scholarship?!" The mother may tell her that she will get the part or that if she doesn't it will be okay, but to "think positive." What does this mean? A better answer would be to do her best and to realize that if the part was not meant for her, that life has a greater plan in store for her. Your life is tailor made for you, and you will either rise up to the destiny version of your story or fall down to the fate version of your story. BUT ITS THE SAME STORY. For instance a life about drugs can have a destiny story in which an addict becomes a treatment specialist and motivational speaker to addicts or a fate story in which the addict dies a horrible drug-related death in order to teach others. This addict's life was preordained by the Creator to teach about drugs. The addict made the choice as to how the story would be told. So this brings me back to NOW. Life does not happen according to our plans, it happens when it is supposed to. In order to cultivate resilience to change, you must realize that you have no control; you are part of a grand design. But there is hope in the NOW. Right now, your awareness can open. You must bring yourself into the present, which most of us have difficulty doing. When you are anxious about what has not occured yet, you are wasting precious energy imagining something unreal- the future. Anxiety means you are not in the present moment, the NOW. When you are embarassed, ashamed, or depressed, you are replaying a perception of the past, which is skewed by your feelings and therefore inaccurate. But also, these feelings are irrelevant to what you can be TODAY. Forgive the past, and let it go, our bodies are meant to let things pass through. We were not made to cling. Resisting the present moment ages, depresses, sickens, weakens and causes disease. Let it go.How do I live in the NOW? When I find myself feeling anxious, depressed, or sad, I focus on something occuring right now, such as the lightness and beauty of my innocent dog. I take care of him in an active way by going for a walk. On my walk, I refuse to allow emotions to rule me. I stay in the present moment by looking at the activity around me, the colors of the tree leaves. If I can appreciate and observe the present moment and keep up with the changes in present time, my mood changes."emotionally stronger" in 10 ways1. Make your bed every morning2. Have a routine on a daily checklist. Recurrent sadness is just like any sickness, you must have a routine to combat it.3. Have your daily list made from the night before of my activities, placing something mindful and spiritual within the first 10 minutes of my day.4. Practice being present in the moment.5. When you feel in despair, reach out to groups, loved ones, and also LOOK FOR OTHERS WHO NEED YOUR HELP6. Continue to search for spirituality7. Remember what you are asking for in reality- Peace. You have spent your life searching for peace in many ways, some of them misguided.8. Your Creator wants for you only peace. You will have it if you keep searching. 9. You are loved, but you may forget that when you are not loving in an unconditional way. 10. I LOVE YOU}}}

It's amazing.   The teenage kid has put on a lot of muscles.  Two ladies have dropped weight.  One has come back from a bad injury to her foot.  This isn't about "being pretty" (though, don't lie to yourself about your own need to feel attractive), it's about being strong, healthy, and having this odd balance that comes from being physically fit.  I can't describe it.  I was seriously overweight and  once I dropped the weight and learned all the balancing "tricks" that comes with boxing, I suddenly was walking differently.  And oddly enough, I realized that the hand-eye-foot coordination helped with dancing too.You just feel better about yourself and—hey—it doesn't hurt to know how to throw a killer left jab or right hook to boot.}}}

Very confident in a work setting and have never had a strong fear of rejection (an abnormally strong one that is - I don't think anyone really doesn't mind it). So why am I wasting your time answering this? Well some time ago, for a whole variety of reasons, I went through a phase in my life where I became very insecure, in social and work settings both. What follows is what helped me with that period of my life. First of all - preparation. I am normally quite quick witted, verbally dextrous, used to love presenting (a.k.a. the sound of my own voice) or telling stories in a social setting but during the period referenced, I lost these qualities. I became nervous when addressed (even on topics in which I was considered an SME), I stammered, I developed a visible tremor in my legs and hands if I had to present or if people were watching me and actively avoided one to one conversations as far as possible. I also had panic attacks for the first time. So back to the preparation. I'd put this in two categories: preparation in advance and preparation in advance of doing. Let me give you an example by way of illustrating what I mean - it is just a convenient one but I used the same methodology for all the situations in your question. Let's use the scenario of a presentation I have to give in work to an audience of some people who know me and some who don't (interestingly the seniority of audience or whether I knew them made very little difference, in fact I was probably more nervous presenting to people I knew). So obviously I prepared my actual slide deck/subject material, that's a given for any presentation. However in the days leading up to the presentation and the night before I would ensure that the following 'talismans' were in place: Dry-cleaned suit.My favourite shirt pressed within an inch of its life.Shoes shined to mirrors.My best/favourite tie.My 'schoolbag' packed, checked and re-checked, i.e. my laptop bag, 'executive' jotter, best pen, spare power cable etc. Presentation sent to my own email, backed up on CD and on a thumbdrive.Secondly for the day, the presentation itself: "get there first with the most." [1]. Meaning get there early, waay before anyone else, ideally (if it was a morning presentation) before start-of-day. This accomplished two things:  Firstly: It helped conquer The Fear (panic attacks) I'd sometimes have between pulling up in my car and walking into the presentation room. No one around to see me = no one to see the tremor in my legs etc. Secondly, it allowed me to set up my laptop, the projector, lay out the printed agenda, set the lighting how I wanted it and so on. You may think so far so presentation 101 but technology is technology and sometimes a projector would not play and then I'd have to reseat cables and so on, which would draw peoples' attention to my hands which might be shaking which would make me more nervous which would - well, you get the picture. Not fun. So now I am suited and booted (and obviously groomed, perfumed, showered and shaven to as close to perfection as someone like me is ever going to get =) and I have commanded the battlefield. All is as well as can be. Now to the presentation itself, I mean delivering it. I know I am going to be nervous and have the jiggy legs and shaking hand thing. So fine. If they are going to behave like traitors, I'll give my limbs something to do. People only perceive nervous tremors when you are trying to be still, so I'd avoid using laser pointers and the like (not hard, I never really liked them) and if I wanted to highlight an area of the slide I'd gesture to it on the screen. Quite often this would mean switching to one side of the screen or the other so I was not blocking the audience's view. So much the better. Legs and hands occupied. Again please note this was already my natural presenting style so it wasn't a huge stretch to become skilled at natural opportunities to keep in motion without dancing around like a cat on a hot tin roof - it is a balancing act, I admit.The killer is when you are asked a question, you can't jump around while the questioner is asking you (without looking deranged) - you have to stand still. Here again I had a variety of tricks - clasping my hands. Flexing my legs from a leaning position as if taking the break to ease a slight cramp (please note: flexing equals straightening an already pretty straight leg, not doing those things Olympic sprinters do - see not looking deranged above). And so on and so forth. So outside of one narrow situation (delivering presentations in work) why do I think all the above has any value to helping your general situation, in work, social, other situations?Because of something I referred to above: The Fear. These words may make sense to you but they won't mean anything to you (right now I think) but take it from someone who knows: it is something that can only control us if we let it. "Easy for you to say, it isn't like I asked for it, invited it in, I woke up one day and there it was, or it crept up on me, whichever.". Well yes, it easy for me to say, now. Because with the 'talismans' I listed above, I was able to push back The Fear just a little bit. Maybe just enough to get through a work thing intially, or meet friends briefly in the pub, small victories. But with each modest victory my juju got more powerful. And before you think the above is too much of a work orientated answer, I am just using work as an example. I had panic attacks even going into regular work, my equivalent of school, I avoided social contact, all the things you describe in your question. The same techniques - adapted for the situation of course - helped me universally. Meeting friends for dinner/drinks? Get there first. Settle yourself. See? Normal? See? Drinking my full-to-the-brim Coke? No tremors! See? Fine...etc. It was a slow process  - maybe a year - reclaiming myself an inch at a time but eventually The Fear was the one cowering in the corner, trapped and panicking and I was the one in control, with my natural confidence rightfully restored to me. "Only thing we have to fear is fear itself." [2][1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat...[2] http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/...}}}

Don't let the simplicity of the technique dissuade you. Everyone that I know of who has actually tried this technique has succeeded with it.I'll put here the short version. You can find out more at How to Release Big and Small Emotions (Release). Also, the book The Sedona Method has an excellent letting-go technique.It helps to understand the structure of emotions. An emotion is an energized thought, and it always starts as sensations in the body. This is obvious with strong emotions like anger or anxiety. Anger starts off with muscular contraction, an increase in adrenaline, temperature, heartbeat and blood pressure, and a hotness in the face. Anxiety may start as sensations in the belly. Even the smallest of emotions starts as a sensation, though we may not be sensitive to the sensations. The sensations start up, and triggers an associated thought-story.With negative emotions, the associated thought-story is usually in voice of the inner critic. The thoughts and sensations then get into a feedback loop, energizing each other, and the emotion gathers up a storm.You will notice that with negative emotions, the first thing we do is contract. We mentally resist and physically contract our bodies, in anticipation how bad it’s going to feel.The technique is a series of questions. Answer quickly. The questions in themselves are not important nor are the answers. The questions help us stop, look, and be aware of what’s going on, and they help us re-learn what we have always known: that it is easy to release any emotion. No matter what the answer is, move on to the next question. With practice the questions disappear and releasing becomes automatic.When you experience an emotion, big or small, ask yourself:Can I make a lot of space for this emotion?Am I able to let it go?Let it goWhen I first decided to try this technique, I thought nothing was really happening for about ten days. I used the technique whenver I felt anxiety and usually answered "no" to "Am I able to let it go?"On about the tenth day, I looked back and realized that I had not experienced any anxiety for the last four days or so.}}}

You are 19 right now, and I was 19 a couple of years back... I know the feeling... A good example would be considering falling for a 'true love' who doesn't even know you or does not acknowledge you... Which hurts in every single way one can imagine... I know cuz I have been there many times and never have I gotten any attention from any girl I have really liked... So much so that I even wrote poems about them, but to no avail... My friends who have had relations and then broken up have started using antidepressants and one of them has been mentally affected so much much that he gets these fits which cause him to grab anything near him and start hitting himself with it... There are a number of problems, as you have outlined, and I know that you know the answer, but let me tell you again... Have a positive attitude... That will change everything for you.People call me crazy... Why? Because I live in a fantasy world... I live in Pakistan, and here, though I live in a good neighbourhood and all, people still are grounded... But I don't consider myself that... My motto in life, as you must have heard of this phrase, is 'aim for the stars... Even if you fall short, you'll land on the moon'. I know people say this is wrong and ye original quote is something else, but I like this version because I think it makes sense... Anyway, what this tells me is that I always have to try and work for my goal... With a positive attitude... Whatever happens, consider it a challenge and with a smile, take it on... Social anxiety, go talk to random people... Depression? So something fun... Depression comes out of boredom, and it don't like boredom... I do whatever my mind tells me and whatever inspires me (and watching anime, I get inspired... ALOT!) I cycle... Play the piano.. I want to be a writer, so I write... I'm doing engineering, so that occupies my mornings in uni (thought I don't study at home :))... I watch anime... Play the play station... Try to learn a language... Almost everyday cycle to one friend or the others house and hang out... I always keep myself busy... As her sherlock Holmes says, an idle mind is the breeding ground of horror... I think it was holmes... Anyway, get my point?In the anime one piece, A woman by the name of Bellemere says to her children before she dies 'live, good things will definitely come.' and in a book by the name of 'hundred year old man who climbed out the window and disappeared', the protagonist always says 'what has happened has happened, and what will be will be.' I advise you read the book... It will really teach you how a person can live freely with no worries at all... Anyway, I hope you understand what I'm trying to say... Most of the time I get sidetracked and forget what I was saying in the first place, but I hope I haven't this time and have conveyed my message. In the end, it is all down to attitude towards all problems... They are either Something to hold you back in life, or challenges that will let you excel where none have gone before \U0001f61c sorry for the cheesy line, I just like it that way...If you like what you read and would like me to, you know, teach you the art of becoming thick skinned like me (I've been rejected so many times for the manuscripts I have sent to literary agents abroad that it will make your head spin, but I have become immune. I DO NOT FEEL SHAME NOW \U0001f61c Hahahahahaha), you can pm me and all... You know, whatsapp and all \U0001f60a haha...Anyway, hope you learn how to see the silver lining and work it all out...}}}

She has been in regular counseling for twenty years, beginning with a proper four-year psychoanalysis.These are her experiences, and mine. After all this experience, she has tremendous communication skills, but claims that the only thing that was *really* effective in changing these feelings of inadequacy was faith. The belief that something larger cared and was guiding her whether the circumstances were good or bad wa the only thing that yielded substantial progress. Further, she says, Christianity was the best solution because, unlike other religions, it does not require you to become perfect first to "meet" the deity, but rather acknowledging your need for help and imperfection reveals it. *Then* you start working to improve, but with the help of the deity. Of course, there are many who believe this is not how Christianity works, but this is what works for her. And me.I have been a Christian my whole adult life, so I have no reference for life without, but I can say that in times when things seemed hopeless or completely impossible, that is when I felt God's pull and direction the most and it always, often miraculously, worked out for my good. You see, whether it's true or not, the belief that bad things are happening now for a greater future good that I can not currently understand is impenetrable mental defense: the worse things get, the larger and more important my future learning or task must be. The trick is to find people who talk about Christianity in terms of faith, not a legalistic tit-for-tat religion. After a fortune spent on counseling, literally, she still goes to counseling, but only for specific things that she needs to talk out.}}}

A lot of this seems to be deep seated issues which I don't think medication or self help books or approaches such as CBT really help with. You need to get to the root of this.For me seeing a Jungian analyst has been life transforming - from early on as the second session. We delved into some underlying reasons which explain my feelings and how to make long lasting changes, and 6 months on I'm so happy and together.Im based in UK and found one via www.thesap.org.uk - they may know of people in other countries.*IMPORTANT* you need to be seeing someone at least once a week. IF MONEY IS TIGHT SAY SO - I have seem many shrinks over the years who've been happy to charge a reduced fee once I've told them I needed help but couldn't afford their fees. ASK. You'll be surprised how many are happy to do this.}}}

If you think drinking helps you, drink as much as you want. Don't stop yourself from doing anything. Remember, you need to be selfish, you need to make yourself happy first, than anybody else in this world. Remember the quote, happiness comes from within, well now you know how it comes.

I often feel this driving need to tell people about my illness, like an excuse or an apology for my behavior. "Why X, you are so bright!  Why do you work at these low paying, dead end jobs?""Hey X, why did you drop out of college three times?""You've been divorced twice?  And you are only 37?""You'd rather stay home tonight?  But it's going to be epic!""You know X, this is the second time you have been sick this month. I'm going to have to give you a warning.""What do you mean, leave you alone?  I'm your husband/boyfriend. Fine. Stay in bed for as long as you want. I'll be on the couch. Maybe if you left the house you just might feel better.  I don't understand?  I understand that you laying around and getting fat is not helping anything!"Every time I go to open my mouth and explain my mental illnesses to someone in response to these statements, I stop. It feels like I'm making excuses. I'm afraid of the labels which will be affixed to me. I don't want to be treated differently. These are real fears, as it has happened to me before when I've shared this information. I've told people I have OCD, which takes different forms. They make jokes about germs, cleanliness, counting. It pisses me off. My OCD is nothing like that. Over the years, I've worked to mask the worst of it. The severe anxiety, the worst of my depression. In public, I hide it as best as I can, and it is exhausting. I can only do it for so long before the facade cracks. Approximately every 3-5 years I crack, and have a break from reality. Treatment sucks, I hate the medications and the last psychiatrist I saw did a number on me. He re-diagnosed me after seeing me for five minutes as a Bipolar II, had me on Lithium, Seroquel, Xanax, Paxil, trazodone and Lamictal all at the same time. When I wasn't sleeping, I was watching cartoons and drooling. He told my employer I could work like this and I lost my good paying job. He told my now ex-husband I was fine to live my life, and he left me. My primary physician took one look at me and had me discontinue everything immediately. So yeah, I don't tell people about my mental illness. I just hope I can keep playing normal as long as possible.}}}

I hated them for it and I hated that I couldn't tell them why I didn't want to do anything or see anyone. I just wanted to stay in bed and even that didn't particularly interest me. I stopped picking up phone calls and stopped reading emails and text messages. I was lonely, but still not alone. I wanted to be alone, but people just kept coming around. Their determination to "fix" me, made me break. I told someone, then someone else and then some more someones. I told work and eventually I told my sisters. That was probably the hardest, telling them that I have depression, felt like saying that I'm not strong enough to be their sister. The more I talk about it, the more I feel like I can take on my depression. Opening up about it has given me a new found strength and more confidence as a mental health professional. However, I still have to deal with the huge stigma on depression in my culture.}}}

There are small, unimportant, and insignificant details of my life that I've hid from people close to me for no good reason.This wasn't a small and insignificant detail. But, since I had all those years of experience not letting anyone know what I was thinking, it felt natural to extend that to mental problems. So, I did.I'm a great liar. Sometimes I tell jokes, and I deliver them so deadpan that no one quite knows if I'm joking or not. I can do that with anything; I sound exactly as sincere as I want to sound. All of this served me well when it came to putting on a show.Also, I was easily able to rationalize my odd behavior. If I slept all day, woke up in the evening, and immediately went back to sleep, it was because I was a teenager, and teens need more sleep. If I lied and faked headaches to avoid going out in public, it was just because I was introverted. If I forgot numerous things that I should have easily known, it wasn't that strange, everybody forgets stuff now and again. If I got deliriously hyper, I was just having a good time. If I tried to read my Physics book over and over before realizing hours later that I hadn't read a single page, I was just bad at science or tired. If I suddenly cut off contact with old friends, I was too busy to talk.This is how I faked it to myself. I built a character of a Jesse who was perfectly normal. Maybe a little eccentric, but there's nothing wrong with eccentric, right? Telling myself that I was fine, even though I had known better for years, put me in the right mindset to act like I was fine.And it was flawless. A seven year performance, and not a single soul realized that they were seeing an act. Everyone who knows about it now said that they almost didn't believe it first; I looked perfectly happy.So, how does it feel? It feels like you constantly want to tell somebody. You play out little sequences in your head of talking to someone, really, anyone. But you won't, because there is something else in your head, something that will shut you down as soon as you start thinking too seriously about it.}}}

Fuck that for a joke.I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 in 2002 and initially hid it from all but close friends and family but as I became more used to having the diagnosis it felt like I was hiding an integral part of me. It became like hiding something beautiful and terrible at once, something that had impacted my life hugely, something that positively added to me and stole from me as well, it is part of me so I decided to expose it unless it could harm me or my loved ones.At my last job I was very open about it but I think that was a mistake as people can use that information to blame you for non related issues, it can be used against you, so I don't know that I will reveal it in a workplace again, but that might be wishful thinking because I really do find it difficult to hide my bipolar from people. The thing is that it's a disease of your body but the part of your body is your mind, every morning and night I take medication for bipolar so it's a disease that's hard to forget for any period of time. Because it's a disease of the mind it's very closely related to my sense of self, it creates thoughts both good and bad, it can cause my death when low or high. To hide this from people is like hiding a great talent and a life threatening disease, it's bloody hard, it's taxing, it is too difficult for me. The last point and one I feel is extremely important is that mental illnesses still have a terrible stigma attached to them, the language society uses can be hurtful to us sufferers, jokes told, characters in movies, how were represented in the media etc, there is a lot of ignorance and bigotry. So if we can, if it works in our lives, then I think it's good to speak up, to say I have such and such a mental illness, this is why I have it, this is what I do to stay healthy, these are some great people who suffer from a mental illness, this is how I suffer, this many people die, etc etc. Brave people have led the way in many civil rights movements for women, African Americans, gay people etc, they were all treated badly, we can be treated badly, but we can also stand together and help educate our societies. We don't have to remain in the shadows without a voice, but sometimes we need to. One last thing, fucken yay for us, were ok, were absolutely fucken ok :)}}}

I had been trying to find women to love me in what I think was a form of self-medication. Love was the only thing that made me feel better, and I wasn't getting what I needed from my wife.However, about five or six months into this, I was really starting to crash, and I was ready to leave my marriage and my family if that is what it took to have a chance to feel happy again. I think that by this time, I was just ready to do a slow motion form of suicide, leaving my wife, my kids, my home, my job, my stable living space, and eventually ending up homeless in a gutter somewhere, and then, I presumed, dying of something. It seemed appropriate to my mood.Instead, my wife wouldn't let me go. She got me to a psychiatrist where I was diagnosed and given Lithium and then a few other meds, as the Lithium wasn't enough to help.At work, I showed up every day. But I did very little. Papers piled up on my desk in haphazard impromptu sculptural designs. I could barely stand to see clients. I have no idea what I must have seemed like. Fortunately, I had assistants -- grad students -- who understood. The had been in the mental health system for various reasons themselves. I found it in me to train them enough to get them started at the beginning of the year, and then they did all the work. I never told my boss. I never missed a day of work. But my office because a place where I came in each day to stare at the computer and then leave at 5. Maybe people noticed, but they never said anything. Another mystery to go along with the one about why my wife stuck with me.With my parents, it was probably the hardest. I believed (and believe) I couldn't tell them because their attitude about my aunt and cousin who are also bipolar is that they are faking it. They could pull out of it if they wanted to. They are just feeling lucky that none of their kids got it. Haha. My brother has been depressed many times. My sister is acting manic. I am diagnosed. But no one tells my parents anything about what is going on, because we were raised never to talk about personal things with family. Our problems are our own problems. Privacy is crucial. Take care of things yourself. Don't expect any help from anyone else once you are on your own.That last lesson was made very clear when I graduated from college in the middle of a recession and couldn't find a job. My parent's solution was to kick me out. I was probably depressed then, too, and suicidal, but it's hard to remember back then with any clarity. In any case, my parents didn't and don't believe in mental illness, and I'm not about to try to proselytize to them. And then there were my friends. This has to be the weirdest. From the instant I started being sick, my friends, who I had been in touch with regularly, stopped all contact. I never said a thing to them, but it was as if there was some news bulletin that had been send out: don't bother me. Don't call me. Don't email me. It still boggles my mind. When I got better, I told a few of them I was bipolar and since I've told them: nothing. A whole lot of no contact. I'd been told that many folks drop friends when they get mentally ill, but I am shocked that my friends are like this. Why do they never reach out? One told me they thought I was voluntarily out of contact and I would reach out to them when I was ready. No mention of the idea that I couldn't reach out. No awareness of how depression disables you.I keep thinking it's something I did. That somehow I have the responsibility. Then I think we should have equal responsibility. Then I think that there are no shoulds, but still. Surely at least one of them would have reached out? They can't all do it at once by coincidence, can they?I can't explain it. It really bothers me. Who the fuck am I, now? What is it like hiding this information from my boss and my family? It's like totally doubting myself all the time. I never believed this about my friends. I didn't think they would drop me when they found out. But look what happened? What a mistake to come open about it. Should I tell anyone else? Especially when I know what they think or when I don't know how they will react? I've been burned. Why would I be open about it? I'm not that self-destructive. I don't know why. I've wanted to die. But still, I try to protect myself. I have a support group I talk to. But I don't tell them everything. They know my wife. I can't tell them everything. I do have a couple of friends who know everything, but they live in other parts of the country. I never get to see them, in person.So I come online, and talk about it anonymously. I don't know why. Maybe it will help others in a similar situation. Maybe it's like confessing. I wish people could know me for real. I wish people could know what a sick fuck I am and still like me, instead of me always having to hide the parts of me that I know they don't approve of. When I'm sick, I can make anyone hate me in about fifteen minutes, when I really self-destructive. I know people's weaknesses and I make them feel I hate them until they can't fight it any more. I don't really want to lose anyone. I know I'll die if I lose everyone, but there are times when I can't hold it together. And it seems easier just to push everyone away than to try to pretend I'm worth anything to anyone, even though I want to be worth something. Some people who love me have been able to hold onto me despite my efforts to push them away. I feel so guilty about testing them, and that makes me feel like I don't deserve them, and that I should push them even harder because they have to see that ultimately this is who I am -- a sick fuck who will only hurt them and hate on them, and it doesn't matter if the brain chemistry is at fault. My parents are right. I am responsible. So I can't let anyone love me. It's not right. I'm only going to hurt them. I'm not worth the trouble. I might be smart. I might be a good father. I might be a good musician. I might be a decent provider. But in the end, none of that matters. I'm worthless. I betray. I cheat. I lie. I am not open about who I am. So when you try to hide, you are inevitably a liar. If not a cheater and betrayer, like me. I lie to everyone around me, all the time. I have no idea how I keep it together. I feel like I have no choice. If I lie, I can try to be happy. I might succeed for a while. If I tell the truth, everyone will shun me and I will die soon thereafter. It is only by lying that I can have a few people love me. The truth will set me free. Sure. Death is the ultimate freedom, and that is what the truth will bring me. Eventually.People like to act like they are tolerant, but I have seen how they react to sociopaths, and that is what they would label me if they knew who I really was. Even my children... perhaps especially my children would hate me, for what I have done to their mother. Ironic. Truth or dare. Well, the consequences of truth are often far more dire that the consequences of lying. Personally, I think people are sick for making society like this. But I would think that, wouldn't I? The alternative is to think I'm sick, and I simply don't believe that. Not now. Maybe not ever.}}}

Our stuggles are just as hard, just as difficult, just as deadly. Either celebrate us or leave us alone, but do not shame us. Do not try to make us small. Do not tell us what we feel is not real. Don't think because you have never suffered from the hell of of a mental illness that it is not real.

I've been through a few diagnosed periods of depression and some mildly manic phases. My mother's manic phases consisted of hallucinations and true delusions. I haven't had manic phases on that scale. Yet.I agree with Anonymous' answer, particularly about the feeling of excuses and not wanting to be treated differently. I'd also like to add:It's exhausting, but most of all it's lonely.How you deal with the ebb and flow of manic and depressed phases could be its own answer, so I won't waste space on that. Lying to and hiding from friends is difficult. I find myself constantly self-assessing what I say so I don't seem delusional or too unrealistic - characteristic signs of mania. I worry about slipping into depression and having to explain why I suddenly can't get out of bed in the morning. The constant worrying and self-assessing is a huge drain.The feeling of loneliness is twofold. I used to tell people about my depression, but it was clear that they didn't understand it (let alone bipolar disorder, which is more complex). The response is typical: It's either pity or a misguided attempt to force me to pull myself up by my bootstraps - to help myself - but I don't want either from them. Reaching out and ultimately being misunderstood sucks.The other part of loneliness comes from the barrier I put up, feeling that it's better just to hide what's going on emotionally. I don't know what I want from my friends knowing, so it seems better not to tell them. I know it prevents me from developing closer relationships with people, but it's a trade-off I'm willing to accept for now. But it's not an easy trade off to feel constantly like I'm holding back a significant part of myself from close friends and loved ones, especially something that makes me so vulnerable.Ultimately, it leaves me feeling more... alone.}}}

Or just cease to be your friend.I thought I'd be open about my bipolar in my new job, but after 18 months not one person has ever felt able/willing to discuss it, including HR.  The stigma is still way too great within our society:  next job I'm not going to tell my work colleagues.  It just isn't worth it.But carrying such a massive burden without emotional support, where you are taking numerous medications that give all kinds of side effects and where you are trying to carry on a regular lifestyle, is overwhelming.  It hurts 24/7 and the intensity of it has made me wish to be dead.  Even if you want to talk about it, it is extremely difficult to find anyone willing to listen.  The only place to go is crisis lines -- and those volunteers are a large part of why I'm still alive.  Trying not to 'spill the beans' on how you're feeling, and feeling like you very much want to be dead is a precarious place to be.  Frightening and lonely, mixed with anger that God would force your life into such a miserable corner, knocked off your perch as one of the 'smart, successful, attractive' ones. And with the constant feeling of aloneness, of alienation.It is a tragedy that so many people with bipolar commits suicide.  And that our society does not have the required compassion to be willing to listen to those who suffer, in miserable loneliness, forcing us to go underground.}}}

Its not easy to trust people, especially after those who promise to help you let you down.  I have had several doctors and I have a lot of anger for some of them, but they are human and it is their job which means they can get bored and locked into habits that are bad, like not actually listening.  I recommend that you keep trying to find away to not hide your mental illness but also to try and find support.  If you can get someone to believe in you maybe it will help.}}}

My father passed away and the person i loved the most, left me. Then started the worst phase of my life; sleepless nights, suicidal thoughts 24/7 and absolutely no interest in anything/anyone around. My mother knew something was amiss but she wasn't ready to accept the fact that i was suffering from MDD. For her and my entire family this was a major stigma and hence no support i received. They weren't ready to even talk about it with me, they never asked me if i needed any help, nothing.I tried killing myself twice, unsuccessful attempts. Then i decided to seek help and went to this psychiatrist.He asked me if i wanted to talk and i said "NO", he just prescribed me few medicines and asked me to see him every second day. He was worried that i might kill myself.As soon as the medicines kicked in, i always used to be too numb and drowsy to think straight. My work suffered tremendously, my personal life and everything associated with it.I lost track of time and anti-depressants just made me numb to react,, no solution to fix the really issue.I changed three doctors and was informed that the "I'm no able to recover from the sense of loss".I was in this mess for 2 years and this somehow never left me completely. I still feel more or less the same, it just that i somehow manage it these days.Going through all this alone makes it all the more depressing. I just wish i feel fine, the way i was in college. I wish life becomes more meaningful, i wish i feel happy for once.I wish.}}}

It involved visits to the psychiatrist and popping happy pills regularly.I didn't tell any of my friends about it at the beginning, because I was afraid of being treated as a weirdo.As for hiding it, it was very easy for me, becauseI had/have very few friends.I was always a private person.All of that occurred at a very important stage of our lives, i.e. while appearing for entrance exams, applying to universities and so on. Obviously, everybody was pre-occupied with their own stuff.After all the chaos ended and when I eventually got better, I told a few of my close buddies. And they didn't believe me at all. So I think I did a fairly good job of hiding my illness.}}}

I cope by flipping it around into something a bit more optimistic. Perhaps this will work for you. :) Consider this: In a harsh and unforgiving universe, your very existence represents an unbroken line of ancestors, ALL of whom survived to sexual maturity, found a mate, had a child, and raised him/her to maturity - all the way back into antiquity. You are their heir. In your DNA lies the genes of survivors, survivors who have experienced human-caused mayhem, and those wrought by the elements. They have witnessed and endured the horrors of war, pestilence, plagues and natural disasters. Not only did they endure them, they successfully birthed children amidst that chaos. This is no small accomplishment, and your life is a goddamn miracle. Most living things fail to pass along their DNA. You represent an unbroken line of those who have succeeded. What matters is what you make of your life right now. Purpose is what we make of it - things that resonate real and whole and true to your core. Personally, I find my own mortality motivating, not depressing. It's a trope in fantasy or science fiction where humans coexist alongside immortal/long-lived races (Elves in Lord of the Rings, the Asari from Mass Effect, etc.), that the long-lived races marvel at how much humans accomplish in their comparably-short lifespans. To those with centuries to burn, any given year (or decade) can be wasted with little consequence. And so the long-lived and immortal do just that. We humans don't have that luxury. When the occasion arises where I speak to a group (a conference, discuss forum, whatever), I like to conclude with a seemingly-easy question: "Without looking it up or using a calculator, how many days do you think an average human in a modern society lives?" Audience members futz around, offer guesses, but rarely does anyone every get it right. The answer? Take your own guess before scrolling down. .......................30,000 days.That's it. I continue: "Since we are here right now, as adults, roughly 10,000 of those days are already gone. Spent. Irretrievably. Likewise, your final 10,000 days will be likely be in diminished capacity -  physically or mentally enfeebled ... or both." As adults, we are in that middle 10,000 days at our prime, right now. What we do, when our strength is at its zenith, is what defines us. Finding meaning through self-absorbed pursuits (accumulating money beyond living expenses, social status, luxury possessions, approval of strangers via Quora upvotes, Facebook 'likes' etc) is futile and dissatisfying. Narcissists fear death with great dread, and rightly so, for death is the great equalizer that obliterates everything they strive for. Attempt to join their ranks, and you will know their dread firsthand. I'd advise against it. Instead - find meaning through service to your fellow humans. Are you literate? Volunteer to teach a recent immigrant to read English. Are you employed? Anonymously donate 10% of your income to a cause that sings to you. See a fellow human being suffer? offer them comfort and give them hope. Are you in good health and over 120lbs? Donate blood and know that a pint from your veins (which your body will replenish in but a month) will keep as many as three other human beings alive. Did someone love you enough to raise you to the literate adult that you are today? Tell them what they mean to you, while they're still alive to hear it.There are a thousand ways to find meaning as a mortal.Find one that resonates with you, and go at it with all your might, while you are in the prime of your life. In 10,000 days, you will wish you started right now. -張敦楷  So live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart. Trouble no one about their religion; respect others in their view, and demand that they respect yours. Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life. Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people. Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide.Always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, even a stranger, when in a lonely place. Show respect to all people and grovel to none.When you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself. Abuse no one and no thing, for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit of its vision.When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.- Chief Tecumseh, from the movie Act of Valor.}}}

Very few of my close friends are still alive. I think of dying much of the time. It does not particularly worry me. In fact it rarely worries most people as they get old. They are mainly concerned with tidying up their lives so they are not a bother when it happens. They try to resolve old issues that separated them from others. They try to get the most out of the day. They try to be contented with what they have. They sometimes try to stay fit. They try to pass on their experience to anyone who will listen. They try to live for the moment. In summary, they try to do what they have realised they should have done all their life but only learnt it in reflection.If you are young, you will learn it as well by the time you are old.}}}

It's been a highly fulfilling decision so far, and who knows, it might even succeed. More to the point, whether or not I personally benefit from my own efforts spearheading the biomedical defeat of aging, 100,000 other people will for every single day that I bring that milestone forward.

I bring the conversation here:Dear inevitable death,Hi,I know we are going to meet each other soon and honestly, I just wanted you to know that I hate you. You are the reason of my perpetual desperate existential crisis and I HATE YOU because of that. I’m happy when I'm oblivious of you but just a small signal, be it a documentary movie about WWII or a cancer patient fighting you face to face, is big enough to put me in a state of despair and fuel me with hatred.So desperate, that it seems, no matter how much science progress I have to still face you. Forever is just too long and the probability of not facing you too small, zero.Dear death, I am sure you have no idea how hard is it to be a non-believer and lose someone you extremely love, otherwise you wouldn't be taking 6000 lives each hour. I don’t know how I can fight you. I’ve created ridiculous religions. It doesn’t work. I’ve created an army of scientists to give me extra life span, to cryopreserve my body, to upload my mind, to restrict my calories, to fight your friend cancer, to make seat belts, to make Penicillin but you are fucking too strong. You have eternity on your side and forever is just too long. I will face you some day. So at least be less cruel and tell me what should I do?Hope to not see you soon,your ultimate hater,Representative of humans, -MostafaDear clueless humanHi,I hope you are not dead yet.I’m very happy that you are cognizant of the fact that I will eventually find you. That the abyss and nothingness is just waiting for you out there. That is a very powerful insight you have.But let me tell you darling, frankly I don’t give a damn. I don’t care about you or your loved one. I don’t give a fuck who you are. I’ll just find you and crush you against the jaws of my time.But I can give you some advice, because that is the least thing I can do for you, so listen and listen carefully because your time is ticking:Stop thinking about me:Now that you know about me, there is no need to know more about me. I am just what I am not. There is no way for you to know me or even worse, doing so shall not get you anywhere. Just don’t try to spend your valuable time thinking about me. It is very good to think to solve some problems but sometimes the thinking is the loophole and you have to cut it short, the more you think, the deeper you dive in, the darker it gets.2. Try to live your life as you were immortal:What would you do if you were immortal? Would you sit a billion years on your couch and watch TV, would you spend the whole time with someone you love, would you learn every sport in the world, would you earn money, Would you help create a better world? Whatever you were going to do if you were immortal start doing it now. Start now, learn, sing, fight, greet, watch, fly, dare, jump, sleep, kiss, forget, and forgive. Each moment is made of infinite smaller moments, each moment is eternal. Suspend and hover in each moment. I know doing so is impossible for you humans but that is the best advice I can give you.3.  YOU MUST KNOW THAT YOU CARE:Your feelings, emotions, fears, love and your hate are all in your head but they are real. They are very important and you should be aware that emotions are alive. They exist as billions of impulses and are as real as a table or electricity. So you should certainly know that you care. Your brain is the product of million years of evolution and before you even start to think about something you have started to care about it. Listen to your emotions, your feelings, they are not going to be less valuable because I exist sometime in the future. They are as valuable as if I never existed. 4.  I know you’re going to fail:I know you more than you know yourself. Your mind is not in your complete control and from time to time you will start to think of me but it is very important, VERY IMPORTANT, that you stop doing so if it is going to put you in a self-pity. Well I’m not saying that you shouldn’t hate me or that you shouldn’t try scientifically to fight me as long as you can, I do believe that you should specially scientifically. All I’m saying is that there is no value in obsessively thinking about me or at least there is more value in doing other things. Your ultimate deathtiny,-DeathPhoto credit: pigeon shrine}}}

Here is some more life long "how to find inner peace with mortality" type advice:Reflect on your fear. What is it about death that is fearful to you? Fear of the unknown? Fear of losing/giving up control? Fear of pain? Fear of running out of time to accomplish everything you want? Fear of change? Take deep breaths. Write it down. Now write down (or just think about) a time in your life (not related to death) where that fear was realized and then identify the outcome, how you/others affected survived, and what was learned from the situation.Realize that nothing alive is forever. Accept that this quality is exactly what makes your (and all) current life so amazing! (with the exception of those immortal jellyfish http://news.nationalgeographic.c..., but that's another philosophical can of worms)Seek some sort of spiritual guidance. Fear of death and fear of being meaningless are probably the most commonly feared things among humans, and one of the main reasons people turn to religion for comfort and support. I suggest talking to people (both followers and leaders) from all different religions and spiritual backgrounds to either synthesize the general sentiments and create your own understanding or find the one that's the best fit for you. (I'm more of an independent synthesizer, but if you choose one religious community, often you will find a lot more continuous support.)Read. This is more a sub-division of #3, but whatever. Two books come to mind right away: The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying, by Sogyal Rinpoche and Easy Death, by Adi da Samraj.Create. Create something that is a non-living permanent extension of you.}}}

Really think about it. Journal it. Get comfortable with the idea.Here is the conclusion I came to (yours may differ, and that's okay). I realized that after death comes... nothing. No more awareness, no more pain, no more fear, nothing. If I continue to exist (a big "if"), it will be in no form recognizable to me now. All worry, all fear, all pain will be so over, it will be as if it never existed.For me, this was a great comfort. There is no point in fearing something if you will have no consciousness or awareness of that thing when it comes.Now I focus on how I live my life and how I enjoy and productively use my time here. I have to admit that I'm still working on this part.}}}

Every day when one's body and mind are at peace, one should meditate upon being ripped apart by arrows, rifles, spears and swords, being carried away by surging waves, being thrown into the midst of a great fire, being struck by lightning, being shaken to death by a great earthquake, falling from thousand-foot cliffs, dying of disease or committing seppuku at the death of one's master. And every day without fail one should consider himself as dead.There is a saying of the elders' that goes, "Step from under the eaves and you're a dead man. Leave the gate and the enemy is waiting." This is not a matter of being careful. It is to consider oneself as dead beforehand.You may not be a warrior, but then again, there are enough questions about code ninjas on Quora that I might be wrong... regardless, if you actually adhere to this advice, and really and truly meditate on inevitable death, you help prepare your mind for this reality, which allows you to also face other more imminent realities.}}}

What you do here does matter and lessons learned here make a difference.  Your being here matters to every person and creature you come in contact with. Every day you make a difference in someone's life. That isn't a small thing.  You can't believe that everything anyone has ever done before us meant nothing. Look at how far the human race has come. Look at art. Look at architecture. Look at the moon; we've been there. This life is just one stage. Death is just the next. See the beauty around you and marvel.}}}

I'm atheist and do not expect to meet anyone--gods, angels, friends, or relatives--in an afterlife, because I can't imagine there really is one. It's just part of the myth. I believe when the lights go out, that's it. Nothing more. When you're young, you don't want to miss anything. So dying would mean leaving before the party's over. On the other hand, dying when you're young is unexpected, so it's not something one should spend a lot of time worrying about. As you age, you find you've accomplished at least some of your goals (you never get them all checked off--who would want to?) therefore leaving would not be so premature, although you hope to stick around a good while longer. What you hope for in midlife is that death, if it comes, will be quick and painless.At my present age, I'm much closer to the end of my life than I am to the start, and I've had a long time to get used to the idea of the curtain going down. It still holds no fear.To summarize: Don't expect to die young. If it comes, let it be a surprise. And do expect to age into an acceptance of the idea. Worrying about, or being afraid of, death will neither prevent it nor make it better. It will only distract you from the life you've got.

Animals that did not fear death were at a disadvantage and did not pass on their genes. It has nothing to do with whether death is unpleasant, nor need it tell us anything (positive or negative) about an afterlife, if there is one. We have that fear for well-understood biological reasons. At any rate, it's just an emotion. It's not something to be ashamed of, or to let paralyze you. Everyone has some form of it. Even people like me who are completely okay with the idea of eventual death would generally avoid its causes. If I were almost hit by a stray bullet, I'd probably have a lot of anxiety. Again, we're biological organisms, and we have millions of years of evolutionary programming sending us signals-- some are harsh, some contradict each other. Perversely, we've been programmed in such a way that desires both permanence (animals generally need routine and find change stressful) but also constant change (lest we get bored, a cause for severe anxiety in higher animals like humans); this is also true of death, we're programmed to want to live forever (even if we understand, intellectually, that immortality would be undesirable, no one wants to die today) and also to die. There is the open question of afterlife. If there isn't one, then there's nothing to worry about or fear. If there is one, it will be interesting to see what there is. I highly doubt that any of the hells or the vengeful gods people have invented (and, conveniently, those supernatural forces always loathe and punish the same people as their inventors) exist. Those fall into two categories: the ones that have been disproven and become historical relics (e.g. Zeus and Ishtar) and those that will be. There may be a higher power one could call a "God" (and he or she may respond to that name, or may not) but the vindictive, eternal-damnation wielding gods humans have invented are about as likely to exist as the Flying Spaghetti Monster. I've read up on near-death experiences, reincarnation research (cf. Ian Stevenson's work), and the various processes used by Eastern (and, increasingly, Western) cultures to validate reincarnations. There is no proof of anything, but I'd say there is slight evidence in favor of some kind of continuation-- reincarnation seems more likely, to me, than not. That said, there's not enough to constitute hard proof and the concepts only raise more questions (what exactly, given the power of genes and the physical brain over everything about us, gets reincarnated?) That gives me enough to believe, however, that some kind of non-negative afterlife is probable. If I'm wrong, the next candidate is that there is no afterlife, which might be a bummer, but (by definition) no one ever experiences nonexistence, so there is nothing to fear from that; it would be exactly like before being born.}}}

Exercise regularly. Those, plus LUCK, and maybe a person can live to 100. Maybe. YouTube.com/watch?v=tR-qQcNT_fY100 years compared with the life of the universe -- 15 billion years -- is dust in the wind.So where does that leave us? With the undeniable inevitability that death will happen to all of us -- Olivia's immortal jellyfish and The Singularity's man-machine immortal future possibly excepted -- and as a result mortality is the common bond that unites all life, and drives our empathic civilization: YouTube.com/watch?v=l7AWnfFRc7gThat empathy helps us deal with the fear of dying by emphasizing what's worth spending our lives on: Love, Understanding, Compassion, and Kindness.Alan Lightman's book _Einstein's Dreams_ paints pictures of many possible universes. In one of them, no one dies, and as a result, each new generation has to live with everyone who came before them. This in turn impedes progress and advancement because old ways and old thinking never die. Which gets me thinking...Perhaps individuals are mortal so individual ideas can be mortal, too.Ultimately I remind myself that courage is not absence of fear. Courage is having fear, but preparing the mind and heart for that course anyway.Dying is the process into which a lifetime of learning culminates.If fear could make a difference to that process, it would be worthwhile; since it cannot, there is no benefit to fear of dying.And perhaps individuals are mortal for a very good reason."It's the one who won't be taken, who cannot seem to give, and the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live." ~ The Rose, YouTube.com/watch?v=u6_s0QIbI94}}}

It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself, "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "no" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important thing I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life, because almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.In other words, everyone will die, and knowing that can be very powerful in helping you face any fears that may stand between yourself and something you'd like to accomplish.Additionally, I also think this video is really powerful: The Hubble telescope was pointed at a seemingly blank patch of sky. After 9 days of exposure, an image was produced of thousands of galaxies.I don't know if this will work for anyone else, but both of these things remind me that any concern I have (such as fear of eventual death) is insignificant, and that I have no reason to be afraid of anything.}}}

Nine and a half hours later I came out.  Six hours after that I woke up in a groggy haze due to the Dilaudid 1:1 PCA attached to a button near my hand. My entire body was swollen. I could not move. I could not care for any of my bodily functions. I was not allowed to eat for 1 week. In 5 days, they got me to stand near my bed. The day after that I walked to the door of my room and back. Soon I was able to walk down the hall.While I lay in bed a few days after the surgery, I was entertaining myself trying to recall all the best books that I had read, as all I could do was look at the ceiling. Plato's "The Republic," Book VII, "Allegory of the Cave," rose to the surface along with Rick Fields' "Chop Wood, Carry Water."While tying to weigh the pro's and con's of each, I dozed off. When I woke up  there was a note from my daughters saying that they would return soon, as I was asleep when they had arrived.It then dawned on me, that they could have arrived to find me in the morgue. As I envisioned that, I began to cry, realizing how close I came to that scene being real and how close they came to being without their father. I felt their possible pain as I recalled my fathers death, which came suddenly and unexpected, one Valentine's Day, long, long ago.As I gained control of my self, I realized, that by some immeasurably slim chance, Death had grasped me, but let go and I was alive. And though two of the most talented surgeons and one of the best OR teams on the planet worked on me, the outcome could easily have been quite different. It was a humbling moment. All the striving, the toiling long hours, plans made and executed in search of that proverbial bras ring, success, in the blink of an eye, made meaningless by this realization of what is truly most important.For, I came to the inescapable conclusion, that every breath I was breathing and every beat of my heart was a gift not to be taken lightly. Because, no matter who you are, now matter your wealth or status, Death can grab you in the next second, a blink of the eye. Whoosh ... and you are gone. Freak accident, unknown genetic anomaly or transecting aortic aneurysm or what ever, it can happen anytime.So, all we are guaranteed is now, the rest is maybe. The insurance companies all bet that you live, for a while, but they don't give guarantees.Long story short, I realized that which is most important are family, and friends, and everyone else in that order. Yes, even the most lost of us is important, the ones that don't strive, the takers and the crazy, they too are valuable to someone, so why shouldn't they be valuable to me.So, now I am going non-profit and have a vision for a 501c3 purchasing group for all 501c3s. I think its low hanging fruit. I don't need to run it, I just think it should happen.And please by all means learn to cherish every day that you wake up, because it could be your last.}}}

If I've lived an honorable life and have done particularly well by a particular deity, say, Frigga, then I will go to their hall after death (Frigga's is Fensalir).If I just lived an honorable life as an average joe and didn't connect with any particular deity and my greatest acheivement was not sucking as a human being, then I go to Helheim, which is actually quite a pleasant place, so the stories say (rather like the Elysian Fields in Roman faith).Now, if I was just a TERRIBLE human being and a blight on others and lived a life of deceit, betrayal, and broken promises, then I would go to Niflheim, which is a frozen foggy abyssal wasteland where the wicked are cast to be forgotten. But again, you have to do some SERIOUS honor-breaking to make it there.And if my life sucked but I didn't intend for things to turn out that way (bad consequences that were out of my control), then the Norns will (probably) roll me a do-over and I will be reborn in my own bloodline for a second, better chance.So how do I deal with the fear of death?I tell myself that I live as honorably as I can, and I WISH to be a good person and go out of my way to not be a bad one, therefore when I die, I will go somewhere pretty nice-- that there will not be a freezing abyss of oblivion waiting for me. I tell myself that what awaits is as good as, if not better, than what I have now. That death is not a thing to be afraid of, but rather looked forward to, as it will unite me with new friends, or reunite me with old ones.Until then, it's all about "balancing the moral checkbook".}}}

In his immortal words, he claimed that "vanity of vanity, all is vanity". What does it mean? it means it's all shit, nothing matters.He goes on to explain that there is no sense to life and nothing makes any difference. For example: "the sun goes up in the morning, at night it sets, and the next morning it goes up again." Basically, you live, you die, makes no difference to anyone.Pretty depressing, right? And I only gave you a couple sentences out of two full chapters full of this stuff!But wait, here's the kicker: on chapter three, what does he tell us?:"For everything under the sky, for every thing there is a time." Followed by one of the most beautiful piece of poetry ever written.So the question is: why is there a time for anything if all is useless and without purpose?My answer is that things only have a meaning when you do them in the right time. "Yeah but...", you're gonna ask: "...when is the right time?". Well, buddy, that's for you to find out, and what makes life so interesting. Go out there, try to figure things out and whether you do things in the right time.Incidentally, he also writes "a time to be born and a time to die", which you usually don't choose, so it not all up to you.Good luck.Ecclesiastes 1 / Hebrew Bible in English / Mechon-MamreEcclesiastes 2 / Hebrew Bible in English / Mechon-MamreEcclesiastes 3 / Hebrew Bible in English / Mechon-Mamre}}}

The true essence of who you are as a consciousness of the universe is eternal. If there is something I notice about life it is that there is a higher power at work. Not a god or goddess, not a mind made religious figure of any sort, but something deeper. Something real, something peaceful. This is where joy and love come from. It's consciousness. We become consumed with our minds, and fear that if we stop thinking we will die. Try and realize that the things you will miss are based on conditioning from the world you live in. Who said you need to excel, who said you need to fight, who said you need to anything? Become present to the now, this very moment, not seconds from now, not months, just now. What is wrong now? Don't focus on your thoughts, and if they begin creeping up, and they usually will, then realize you, as a conscious being, can choose not to listen to those thoughts. Your mind will tell you you're worthless, hopeless, that you don't fight, that you aren't this or that, that you don't have what they have, and on and on it will go until it dies. The secret is to let it die so that you may live. Merely view your thoughts as nothing more than a child at play. Laugh, smile, and die to the past every second. View emptiness in the world, and you will see how full it is, listen to the underlying silence that surrounds, and hear the music of peace.So, what is the mind?The mind was meant to be a tool, to be used for a specific task, and then put away like any other tool. Instead, humans let it run their lives; so, the mind uses familiar conditioning from the past to build its ever approaching future. Sadly, the mind does not differentiate what feelings and memories it latches onto in the past, and seeing as pain is the truest creation of the mind, it is oftentimes what is brought forward. What you see as failing is merely what past conditioning tells you is failing. The body is nothing more than a vessel for a feeling to pass through, the mind is what latches onto the feelings and makes them a continuous memory. Listen to that deeper consciousness, and seek truth from within, break passed your conditioning and seek the truth. It is a simple truth, but the mind is hard to break, you will struggle through its grasp as it brings up the most painful of memories in a last ditch effort to survive. But soon you will see that it has no control over you, rather you over it. As for your purpose, and you being nothing more than an "accidentally evolved creature."We are all made up of the very stars that sustain life, the planets we have felt and reach for, the impossibilities of the universe. You need not look far to reach the stars for the stars are within you, grab one. Feel the energy of the universe coarse through you, feel consciousness, hear silence, and see emptiness. There is an energy, it is like a vibration through the body, and we drown it out with mind made pain. Feel your body from within, feel the universe from within. And next time someone asks you what you have accomplished, smile, and tell them you felt peace, joy.}}}

I despise the thought that I'll be less active, probably sick, and probably changed. But hey, there's no cure to either (shrugs). Until then, you could keep your mind off of death by enjoying the time you have here. That brings me to an interesting question (rhetoric, or not is up to you). Would you enjoy life knowing you had an eternity? Sure, you would have a lot of time to learn and try new things, but would you find everlasting life monotonous or spectacular? But in a way, you will go on forever in a sense. Atoms are forever, so when you die, your atoms will be recycled and used to form a different being. Back to the question I hardly answered, I honestly say I have no sound advice. All I can offer to you is my directionless musings, which maybe be a parallel to life itself... directionless, formless, meaningless... unless you inject your own purpose and color into it.}}}

The last few years close friends and family have passed away and they were young. Also, I have had two children. So while all this death was going on, life was simultaneously being brought into existence. That and I watched every season of " Six Feet Under " the week after my daughter was born. ( Hey I was up all night and breastfeeding,lol I needed something interesting to keep me up. )Moving right along............... Whenever I get a deep unnerving sense of my own mortality, I mainly worry about two things- Dying before my kids are adults and settled. Second thing, one of my kids dying before me. These are the two main fears.After that I start to just be scared in general of dying and what in the hell is going to happen to me spiritually speaking. I mean, I believe in God, but hey, it's still scary to think about. I worry I will be afraid in spirit form lol. Sounds dumb I guess....but I can be an anxious person. What if I fumble the ball on the exit? lol.I don't know if this is helpful. BUT when I start freaking out and spinning! I have a few suggestions. 1. Don't call your parents for advice. lol I called my dad and told him I suddenly was scared shitless of dying someday. He then replied, " Well shit.....how do you think your mom and I feel, we are a lot closer to death than you are? I have no idea what to tell you. Just ignore it. It's morbid. " Thanks dad lol. I told him that response was not at all comforting.2. However, one thing I did learn from this hilarious phone conversation? Everyone is going to die someday. We are all in it together. So I guess it is better to be dying with the whole world, instead of just you being the only person who is mortal lol. Right? So that takes some of the edge off......3. Also, how do you know you don't have any purpose? As a science guy, I would think you above all other would appreciate that every singe living organism DOES have a purpose for evolution and existence. You may not have the foggiest idea what that purpose could be. And hey, does it even matter if you do know? I mean, does the first fish that ever existed serve a purpose for life on earth? Do you think said fish worried about if it would be known in 200 years? Nope. BUT hey, it lived for a reason. JUST as you do my friend.AND you will die for a purpose too. Why? Hell if I know.But when you do, the good news is, you won't be alone.}}}

If you have enough time to think about dying and worrying about it, then you are not fully occupied, IMHO. Maybe do social work, which will help you appreciate what you do have and help you focus on things which will have a positive impact on lives of the less fortunate. Find things that give you joy and do more of it. Once you are happy, you will not have time to think of death.}}}

Every bit that once made up you will continue to exist indefinitely, leaving your footprint across the vast cosmos."You want a physicist to speak at your funeral. You want the physicist to talk to your grieving family about the conservation of energy, so they will understand that your energy has not died. You want the physicist to remind your sobbing mother about the first law of thermodynamics; that no energy gets created in the universe, and none is destroyed. You want your mother to know that all your energy, every vibration, every Btu of heat, every wave of every particle that was her beloved child remains with her in this world. You want the physicist to tell your weeping father that amid energies of the cosmos, you gave as good as you got."And at one point you'd hope that the physicist would step down from the pulpit and walk to your brokenhearted spouse there in the pew and tell them that all the photons that ever bounced off your face, all the particles whose paths were interrupted by your smile, by the touch of your hair, hundreds of trillions of particles, have raced off like children, their ways forever changed by you. And as your widow rocks in the arms of a loving family, may the physicist let her know that all the photons that bounced from you were gathered in the particle detectors that are her eyes, that those photons created within her constellations of electromagnetically charged neurons whose energy will go on forever."And the physicist will remind the congregation of how much of all our energy is given off as heat. There may be a few fanning themselves with their programs as he says it. And he will tell them that the warmth that flowed through you in life is still here, still part of all that we are, even as we who mourn continue the heat of our own lives."And you'll want the physicist to explain to those who loved you that they need not have faith; indeed, they should not have faith. Let them know that they can measure, that scientists have measured precisely the conservation of energy and found it accurate, verifiable and consistent across space and time. You can hope your family will examine the evidence and satisfy themselves that the science is sound and that they'll be comforted to know your energy's still around. According to the law of the conservation of energy, not a bit of you is gone; you're just less orderly."}}}

You are something that the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is something that the whole ocean is doing… The real you is not a puppet which life pushes around; the real, deep down you is the whole universe.So then, when you die, you’re not going to have to put up with everlasting existence, because that’s not an experience. A lot of people are afraid that when they die, they’re going to be locked up in a dark room forever, and sort of undergo that. But one of the interesting things in the world is–this is a yoga, this is a realisation–try and imagine what it will be like to go to sleep and never wake up. Think about that.Children think about it. It’s one of the great wonders of life. What will it be like to go to sleep and never wake up? And if you think long enough about that, something will happen to you. You will find out, among other things, it will pose the next question to you. What was it like to wake up after having never gone to sleep? That was when you were born.You see, you can’t have an experience of nothing; nature abhors a vacuum. So after you’re dead, the only thing that can happen is the same experience, or the same sort of experience as when you were born. In other words, we all know very well that after other people die, other people are born. And they’re all you, only you can only experience it one at a time. Everybody is I, you all know you’re you, and wheresoever beings exist throughout all galaxies, it doesn’t make any difference. You are all of them. And when they come into being, that’s you coming into being.- Alan Watts, from The Nature of Consciousness}}}

No answer here. It most fundamentally has to do with assumptions you have about the world and your existence in it. Since you experience fear, you probably interpret dying as a threat. This is of course very understandable, since the thought of being dead directly threatens your basic instinct to survive. So it is only natural to feel fearful in the face of (imagined) death.But since you ask this question here, I'm quite sure you think about this a little more than you probably want to.Maybe you can look into what causes you to think about dying and you being dead. What circumstances cause you to think about it? What else is going on besides your perfectly natural fear of death? Could that be contributing to your fear?}}}

This is the driving force of my regret: after I make a mistake, I will forever be the guy that made that mistake. If I get hit by a car and die today, what could anyone say about me? I've never really "accomplished" anything. I was born. Lived a few years. Went to school for a bit. ...That's about all that really happened. If I die today, the best thing anyone could say at my funeral was that I had "potential".The terrifying part is when we realize the difference between:How we picture ourselves to be in the future. This includes our goals, aspirations... anything that may not exactly feel practical, but is definitely possible.Who we are. If you haven't done anything yet about your aspirations, it doesn't matter the stage of life you're in once you're dead. Maybe you were about to become a lawyer, and were preparing for the bar exam - well, that doesn't matter, because you still weren't a lawyer. Maybe you were wondering if you had cancer, and were on your way to the hospital - well, that doesn't quite matter anymore, either; firstly, because you're dead, and secondly because you never made it there, anyway. Maybe you were about to become a murderer - it does not matter what you pictured yourself to be; as long as you died before you ever tried to kill anyone, you're just some guy. There's nothing else to say about you, for better or for worse.Very recently I came to a (somewhat obvious) realization that I never have before, and I've found that it kind of helps. What I described about opportunity above is, for me, genuinely terrifying, but sometimes I manage to re-assess what the "meaning of life" is. To me, it doesn't matter what your values are, because life is just about seeing how far you get before you die. Will you die at 8? 17? 81? What you did with yourself is superfluous, because as long as you have time left, there's always some ever-narrowing realm of possibility. Once you're dead, it doesn't matter if you never graduated high school, or never got married, or never had a kid. Some people might believe that it matters, but this belief is useless. Nothing will ever change. It's pointless to mourn opportunity.I understand that you can't characterize anyone with a number. I'm not saying that age is a measure of self-worth, but instead that we shouldn't live our lives with the only goal being to "make something of ourselves". Sure, that's something vaguely admirable to go for, but life is primarily about living. If I die today, then that kind of sucks for me, but at least I did a few things I'm kind of happy I was able to do. Did I make a lot of mistakes? Absolutely. Still, I don't think it was all for naught.}}}

In due time, during which universe is expanding a small piece of rock came to existence some 4.54 billion years ago. This rock happened to facilitate forming of self replicating cells which took a laborious period of 3.5 billion years to give rise to 8.7 million species who are survivors of a process which wiped out 99.9% of species. One such species, homo sapiens  has developed to such an extent to invent culture, music, language, art, religion, technology, government, science, sports etc. You are one such being, just imagine how lucky you and I have been to exist and experience life. We are also lucky to be in a time capable of understanding all these which far exceed our reach in space and time. The fact we understand all these questions is in fact due to our going search for questions you are asking, we have collectively achieved nothing short of a miracle in our collective effort to understand and appreciate life. Asking for purpose is a natural question and our understanding so far points to no purpose. Lets suppose we scientifically find a purpose (which I don't think is even possible), and we spend our lives trying to fulfill this purpose and perish have we led a meaningful life? Does your answer change if the scientific claim of this purpose is falsified due to our collective effort? The reason we seek purpose is to help us justify our life. Ask not for purpose of life, but give purpose for your life. "What ever great thing I do, doesn't matter in the long run (say, after 200 years)." , make it matter to you. Give purpose to your life whatever it might be. Almost any contribution in any field, sport, art, labour etc is in fact going to affect thousands of beings make sure even this tiny effect is what you want your life's purpose to be.Our fear of death, ceasing to exist is ironically only possible during this existence. Instead of worrying about not experiencing something lets try to appreciate whatever it is we are experiencing and in the mean time make it better for others too. “I wish it need not have happened in my time," said Frodo."So do I," said Gandalf, "and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.” “I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.” - Mark Twain}}}

I will further answer this question so that it is more suitable fr the new question)Part IWhat you do does have an enormous effect in the long run. Here is a brief description of the butterfly effect:In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change at one place in a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state. The name of the effect, coined by Edward Lorenz,  is derived from the theoretical example of a hurricane's formation  being contingent on whether or not a distant butterfly had flapped its  wings several weeks earlier.WikipediaYou know how there are those movies where someone time travels, changes one little thing, and they arrive in a completely different universe when they zap back to the present future?Well who says that you need to travel back in time to make a dramatic change? If the flap of a butterfly's wings can generate a hurricane in the future, imagine the impact you are having on the future.Imagine what a simple act can do? A simple act can dramatically affect the so called "long run". Let's say you just finished eating at a restaurant and you hold the door for someone. You don't notice, but that person has had a horrible day, and having someone hold the door for them makes them feel good. Therefore, they got a little bit of energy from you and with spending less time at the door, the person is able to get to the car just a little bit faster and start the car a little bit faster. They are now one second ahead of the alternate universe where you didn't hold the door for them. Being one second ahead made the person pass the red light he always got stuck on. This made him feel even a little bit better. While avoiding the light, the person got a glimpse of the car's bumper sticker in front of him: "Gym Tan Laundry". That sat  in the back of his mind and didn't make a difference until the person got home to his family. Feeling a bit better than usual, the subliminal thought at the back of the man's head turned into a thought. "My wife's doing the laundry, I feel like going to the gym" completely unaware of the sticker he saw. Now the man really hasn't gone to the gym to work out in a while, and after glancing at some of the attractive "tan" women there (please, if you have a problem with men politely glancing at other women you have a problem. Roughly half of the world's population is women, and the probability of our eyes landing on one is fairly reasonable), he gets a little boost of energy in his run. 5 miles in 40 minutes. The man feels amazing as his pores are opened, and the breaths he makes are like gasps for life. He goes home, happy as hell, with his wife reading a book, as any other night. But she won't be reading the book for long, because this is the night where they do it. The next morning, feeling satisfied for the first time in a while, the man gets ready for work, and goes to the restaurant he always goes to after work, but this time he invited his co workers, and after a few drinks, they were all great friends. Right as they leave the restaurant (sober), there is a sad looking fella trailing behind the man's group, but instead of ignoring the poor guy, the happy man patiently holds the door. It may sound ridiculous that something little, such as holding a door, can change someone's day dramatically (not always for the better, but I decided to make this a nice story to get my point across). What I am trying to get at here is, yes, every little thing you do does matter. Every time I open the door and notice someone close behind me, I keep the door open. I always find an interesting pattern when I do this. Almost always (to give a number, I would say around 75%) hold the door for the people who are close behind them (not including crowds where someone always has to hold the door). But doing the little things everyday, especially the nice things, will eventually change the world, for better or worse.3 weeks later...The man receives a call from his wife that she's pregnant.Hope I helped.Part II Dealing with DeathThe way I look at death is simple. Who cares? Take an example from accounting (bear with me for a sec). The basis of cost accounting is relevance. The meaning of relevance is the ability to change someone's decision. For example, should I take the train home or the car? The relevant things to consider are the cost on gas, the price of the ticket, and the depreciation on your car. They are relevant because in making a decision whether to take the train or not, those factors change with the decision you make. In other words, it is relevant to consider the cost of the train ticket because it impacts your decision. If the train ticket was 50 bucks, but you only commute one hour away, you would choose to take the car since it would be cheaper. See how that made a difference in your decision? Let's say now that the time it takes to get to your home using the car is 30 minutes, and the time it takes to use the train is also 30 minutes. Since the time it takes for you to get home is the same in each situation, time does not have an impact on your decision, and therefore is not relevant.So how does this tie into the philosophy of death? Well, think about it. Death is irrelevant. In the end, we all die. Whether you decide to stick with that horrible but secure job, or take a risk and start your own exciting start up, who cares about death? Death is irrelevant in all of our life decisions (on the exception of choosing a life insurance plan). But what we do in between that time of being born and dying is very relevant. Think back to the train example. Time is not relevant in making our decisions because we arrive home at the same time, 30 minutes. But if you would have taken the train, you could have read a newspaper on the way home. You could have started a conversation with a complete stranger, who you realized shares the same interests as you, and who in fact sits right behind you at work, in that even smaller cubicle. Where you get off the train, you depart with a friend, where if you decided to drive home, you would have arrived home in solitude.The destination is stagnant and irrelevant, but the path itself is always moving, and always relevant.Who knew you could use accounting in philosophical thinking?}}}

I believe that my life is a bit like a standing wave, a peak supported by my millions of ancestors. I will join them in death, supporting the next peak, my children. The wave analogy I find simplifies the notion down to an easily expressed idea, as each successful birth is like another ripple we make in life's ocean, you can make a lotta waves! It's important too that one realises that offspring aren't the only way of making an impact and this is where we find satisfaction, in our creativity.

But in reality we don't even know that much about our selfs... who am i, what makes me happy, what am i capable of achieving?I believe people have multiple talents that are yet to be discovered by them selfs. Once you start exploring yourself instead of what's outside, you will realize that life is becoming more interesting because you are constantly discovering/ learning new things about yourself.People are explorers, we are fascinated about life and everything that is in it.I suggest that you start your journey by finding the secrets that lie within you and then you will get the satisfaction and answers that you were looking for.You are that matters, you are the universe.}}}

You experience what the enlightened experienced before they reached awakening. There is a seed of enlightenment in you.One of the characteristics of people who are truly seeking truth is the loss of passion! Wow you actually experienced that! And keep realizing that truth, that we will all will die one day! Do not run away from that fact! Do not think that realizing that truth is wrong. You are on the right track! Let the truth consume you each day! Continue to dwell with that truth! Isn't all things transient? Dont all things come today and gone tomorrow? Dont we live in very limited time?All things, darling, all things are impermanent. Let that truth seep into the depths of your soul.Do not try to be happy! Who says you must be happy?Do not trust those who bring you mesmerizing hope that you can be happy again! Do not fall for their seasoned embellished answers. Yes they may look beautiful but they are actually shallow and insubstantial. They aint gonna bring about the peace you are looking for.Let me ask you: are you really serious in asking this question?

As such when she opens her pandora box , she finds not even the least of things: hope. As obliteration of the soul upon death is harsh to digest, without religious beliefs regarding afterlife a man can easily fall into despair , sadness and eventually to a dead end that combined with daily stress of life can yield to depression.

What is the solution for me to be happy?4+ Comments Loading... }}},{{{Quoted form book Life Ahead by Jiddu KrishnamurtiQuestioner: Everybody knows we are all going to die. Why are we afraid of death?  Krishnamurti: Why are you afraid of death? Is it perhaps because you do not know how to live? If you knew how to live fully, would you be afraid of death? If you loved the trees, the sunset, the birds, the falling leaf; if you were aware of men and women in tears, of poor people, and really felt love in your heart, would you be afraid of death? Would you? Don't be persuaded by me. Let us think about it together. You do not live with joy, you are not happy, you are not vitally sensitive to things; and is that why you ask what is going to happen when you die. Life for you is sorrow, and so you are much more interested in death. You feel that perhaps there will be happiness after death. But that is a tremendous problem, and I do not know if you want to go into it. After all, fear is at the bottom of all this - fear of dying, fear of living, fear of suffering. If you cannot understand what it is that causes fear and be free of it, then it does not matter very much whether you are living or dead. Questioner: How can we live happily?  Krishnamurti: Do you know when you are living happily ? You know when you are suffering, when you have physical pain. When somebody hits you or is angry with you, you know suffering. But do you know when you are happy? Are you conscious of your body when you are healthy? Surely, happiness is a state of which you are unconscious, of which you are not aware. The moment you are aware that you are happy, you cease to be happy, don't you? But most of you suffer; and being conscious of that, you want to escape from suffering into what you call happiness. You want to be consciously happy; and the moment you are consciously happy, happiness is gone. Can you ever say that you are joyous? It is only afterwards, a moment or a week later that you say, "How happy I was, how joyous I have been". In the actual moment you are unconscious of happiness, and that is the beauty of it.}}}

You're not going to die tomorrow, are you? And once you're dead, you won't have anything to worry about, or the capacity to worry in the first place. The only thing that is unpleasant about death is the pain of the transition. But worrying doesn't offer any benefit. All a person can do is deal with the issues that come up in the present moment, and if you aren't about to die, then it's not something to worry about. This whole "dealing with the issues you face in the present" is what living is. What is your worry with death, anyway? That you will lose out on life and the quality of life, right? But when you worry about death before you are actually dying, then you are losing out on the quality of your life in the present moment. So live, don't worry.}}}

What is the solution for me to be happy?4+ Comments Loading... }}},{{{I suggest you to read the immortal of Borges. A small fragment:There is nothing very remarkable about being immortal; with the exception of mankind, all creatures are immortal, for they know nothing of death. What is divine, terrible and incomprehensible is to know oneself immortal. I have noticed that in spite of religion, the conviction as to one's own immortality is extraordinarily rare. Jews, Christians, and Muslims all profess belief in immortality, but the veneration paid to the first century of life is proof that they truly believe only in those hundred years, for they destine all the rest, throughout eternity, to rewarding or punishing what one did when alive. In my view, the Wheel conceived by certain religions in Hindustan is much more plausible; on that Wheel, which has neither end nor beginning, each life is the effect of the previous life and engenderer of the next, yet no one life determines the whole... Taught by centuries of living, the republic of immortal men had achieved a perfection of tolerance, almost of disdain. They knew that over an infinitely long span of time, all things happen to all men. As reward for his past and future virtues, every man merited every kindness -- yet also every betrayal, as reward for his past and future iniquities. Much as the way in games of chance, heads and tails tend to even out, so cleverness and dullness cancel and correct each other. Perhaps the rude poem of El Cid is the counterweight demanded by a single epithet of the Eclogues or a maxim from Heraclitus. The most fleeting thought obeys an invisible plan, and may crown, or inaugurate, a secret design. I know of men who have done evil in order that good may come of it in future centuries, or may already have come of it in centuries past... Viewed in that way, all our acts are just, though also unimportant. There are no spiritual or intellectual merits. Homer composed the Odyssey; given infinite time, with infinite circumstances and changes, it is impossible that the Odyssey should not be composed at least once. No one is someone; a single immortal man is all men. Like Cornelius Agrippa, I am god, hero, philosopher, demon, and world -- which is a long-winded way of saying that I am not.}}}

Of course the despicable fear of death which trails every man like a shadow is the conscious conviction that he is not spiritually speaking, living aright. Or to put it more socially, he is not being truthful to himself and his environment.For let us look at the subject more critically.Supposing the questioner originally hails from India but resides in Nigeria.Then one day he receives an emissary from his family in India requesting his presence at home in say a week's time.Only a guilty conscience would make him to avoid or decline that invitation where possible whereas a clear conscience would be looking forward to it.Fear of dying is a further proof that the majority of us have yet to comprehend the very essence of living.We do not know the how why and where of existence.Only a logical answer to the question of who am i? Where do i come from and why am i here? would expel the fear of death as well as clarify on the continuation of life Page on Thereafter assist the questioner and people of like minds, i would recommend a thorough examination of the work:   by Abdrushin}}}

Denial.Deny the fact that you are going to die by obsessively focusing on the fact that you are not dead yet. This is kind of like what's happening today with the looming Budget crisis. Recite some emotional quotes. Tell yourself: "At least I have lived." Go to a hospital ward, see people in pain. Say to yourself: "Pain is bad. Pain is really, really bad. Pain must be worse than death. Death isn't so bad. At least it's not pain."Convince yourself that death isn't as bad as you really think it is. Look at the world through the perspective of the Hubble telescope, and tell yourself: "The universe is bigger than any of us. It was here before me and it will be here after me. I am a part of it. Therefore, even if I die in my human form, I will still be here, for the universe will still be here. I can't understand it. Of course I can't. But that doesn't mean it's as bad as I think it will be... Since I can't understand it, I will convince myself that it's not what I think it is."Give up your own thoughts on the matter. Look instead for a spiritual guide who will give you the answers you want to hear. Go to a cemetery. Look at all the dead people. Say: You're dead. Ask: Are you in pain? Are you sad? Are you fearful? Project the answers you want to hear. The person you are talking to is dead, and cannot point out the fact that you are just lying to yourself. Speak: I am dead. I am not sad. I am not in pain.Another way to deal with fear of death is to try to combat it, and hope that you can win. A few people are attempting this. Aubrey De Grey and Ray Kurzweil come to mind.Another way to deal with fear of death is to buckle in and brace yourself.}}}

One can always console you by turning to religion. Every one of them have ways to help you deal with death, and the hereafter. But then you may not be a very religious person. So, how does one answer this?Let me put a hypothetical situation to you. Suppose you had a choice to become immortal? And with your fear of death you take it up. What would your situation be?Slowly, every one around will die, one by one. all your peers will get older and pass away. Your friends will go. Your parents of course would have gone ahead. Your siblings will go. Then even your children and grandchildren will go. You'll be  left behind. Let me tell you, there is one thing worse than death - that is to be left behind all alone when all your people have gone. When all that you have known is changing, and nothing is what you knew anymore.You'll then want to be there where they have all gone, wherever they all are. You'll wish with all your heart that you had never opted 'not to die.' This kind of loneliness is worse, far worse than death.I can illustrate. With a brief glimpse of a similar situation. When the last day in school came, we were all very sad. We know that one part of our life was over and that we would never be children again. We wished with all our heart that we could stay frozen in school forever. But we had to go on, and we went - each our ways, to college and so on. A few months later, I went back to my school to collect something. My juniors were in the top class, there were several new faces, there were subtle differences in the way my old teachers spoke to me. Somehow things seemed to have changed. I really didn't belong anymore. Nothing was the same anymore. That's when I realized that it is good to move and move on, all the time. Stasis is death. Staying back is death.My grandmother is 97 now. All her peers have passed away. She is the last of her generation. She misses them terribly. she feels that they left her behind. She is quite happy with all of us, her grandchildren and great grandchildren. But she wants to go. She prays everyday for release. She is looking forward to death. Death has become attractive to her. It is not death anymore to her. Its the beginning of a new existence.}}}

What reactions do you expect from the people?(not of the media, please! ). Some would consider it as a super power and for some it is an incurable illness.You know why? Not all love their own lives.It is clear that you would love to live long. Congrats.You are one of the few brave creatures of the planet. But it would have been even more wonderful if you loved what you are doing with your life right now. Believe me when you love what you are doing, you will be least concerned about what's going to happen even in the near future ( atleast you will not care about things that are not in your hands). All you care about will be the work you are passionate about. You will start understanding yourself when you stop sitting in the dark rooms thinking about your life and start working in areas you are passionate about.You will find no time to be depressed. You will start loving yourself. Because you will find yourself. Yes you are one of the trillion living creatures existed/existing on earth,unnoticed yet important. Important, in there own little world they create around themselves.Imagine a tiger licking it's cub with love.Why does she do that? We don't even care about them. So does it matter?  It does. Not to us but to the cub it matters more than anything else in this world. Similarly, to the world you might be 'one of the many accidentally evolved creatures' but to yourself and the many people who silently care about you, you are important. Really really important. What you do matters to them.  So whatever you do,do as if it makes a difference . It does.}}}

Of course it's hard to think that we may go through terrible suffering. Nobody who has ever died in awful suffering has ever choosed it nor believed it would happen that way, which means that it can happen to anyone of us as well. It's hard to live with that fear. But to some extend, we can reduce the risk by avoiding risky behaviours.Being dead itself is not such a big thing, whatever there is, if there is something.To be honest, I have never understood why most people constantly overrate life.Giving birth to a kid is NOT good news, it is a pure act of selfishness. It's creating from 0 the possibility of suffering, experiencing problems, frustrations, and the certainty to have to face death.Just try, every night, to write down in a book if your day was worth living, on a scale from -10 to +10. Do it everyday for one or 2 years. Then ask yourself "was this year a pleasant year for me?" Whatever you answer, the result will be higher than te average mark of your daily report. This is a proof that we tend, for survival and social status reasons, to over estimate our pleasure of life.Consider also, because if you're on Quora, you probably belong to priviledged people as I do, that most lives are harder than ours.So for myself, I'm just hoping that my death will be a pleasant one, and that it will repair the terrible selfishness of my parents, who inflicted life to me without my consent. I was not necessary in this world, and my suffering, from boredom to anger, through diseases and problems would have never existed without my parents' silly obedience to social laws.I'm afraid of dying, but I'm looking forward to being dead.}}}

I'm feeling sad, What should I do about it? When I look my face in the mirror, sometimes a flash occurs to me that I'm going to eventually die (for whatever reason at some point in time). I feel sad for a few minutes.  Since, I'm also interested Geology and when I compare the geological time scale (with all the multitude of organisms due to evolution) with my daily time, I feel depressed that I'm no more than one of the accidentally evolved creatures on this earth. What ever great thing I do, doesn't matter in the long run (say, after 200 years). I'm going to be one of the trillion organisms existed on the earth, without any purpose. These thought pervades in the daily life of mine and I lost passion to do anything.  I don't fight. I don't excel. I want to be happy but I cannot be happy because every instant  of my life I've to realize this harsh truth.

When I have high energy, my mind can spaz all over the place.   First, if you have racing, manic thoughts a lot, to the extent that you are exhausted when you left alone and not sleeping.  Talk to your doctor, there might be something else going on, a chemical or hormonal imbalance that she can help you with.  Something struck me right away about your post.  I think you omitted something on your reasoning: lack of a structured thought process.Perhaps you take it for granted, or perhaps you didn’t think of it.  Either way, I thought it was worth mentioning. Giving structure to my thoughts has been the #1 thing that helped me deal with obsessive over thinking.  I cannot stop this habit, but I can process it and in that way, control it. Like other things in your life, your mind needs order. It needs priorities, it needs deadlines, and schedules.  And then - and this is crucial - it needs a task-master.  YOU!There are many ways to add this mental scaffolding. If you like order, you will take to it instinctively.  Here are some general concepts, I’ve found helpful;Process: As you take in information or think about things, you have to process the thoughts or they pile up.  File them in your brain or put it into an outline or issue tree.  This ishard to do mentally, so start out doing it on paper.   What category do these thoughts fit into?  How do they relate? What is important, what isn’t?    Prioritize: Identify what you care about.  What do you want to spend time thinking about?  Dismiss thoughts that are not important.  If you try to think about everything all the time, you’ll end up thinking about nothing.  Narrow your focus, don’t read all of Quora all the time.  Say outloud that is not interesting to me and move on.  This is not being ignorant, this is protecting yourself from being mentally overrun.  Take notes: Are your thoughts about concepts, intellectual in nature?  Or about tasks?  Get thoughts out of your head by writing them down.  I always have notepads next to me.  When something pops up, I write it down.  Then I move on.Schedule:  It is ok to say I’m not going to think about this right now.  I will think about this later.  And then stick to it.  The more you force structure and train your brain to organize, the easier it gets.  You not only clear your mind and control the thoughts, you also get more out of your thoughts.  I know what you are going through and I really wish you the best of luck!!}}}

You can work on or mask the weaknesses, and you can look for challenges that play to your strengths. Competitive environments require such an approach.On the other hand, you also describe anxiety.

Either way, 7 schools is probably a bit on the short side, since it does expose you to some probability of no admits.Don't be disheartened.  If you want to go for graduate school, then keep trying, and maybe broaden the search.  If you're only applying to the top 7-10 schools, then there's a very high probability of getting rejected regardless of how good your application looks.  You didn't mention whether it was for MS or for PhD.  Remember that MS admission is a lot more random than PhD admission.Finally, never compare against others in times like this. Your success or failure is your own, and it does not grow or diminish regardless of how others have fared. Believe in your own ability, and push forward.  I've often found that students who have experienced some adversity such as this, often end up with a chip on their shoulder, and a stronger drive to work harder than their peers. This ultimately can be a big positive factor on your career.  Remember that success in graduate school or academia is a long road over many years. No single event will make it or break it.  The road is long, and only the results at the finish line matter.}}}

No getting around it.  There are tons of sweet or mean or even enigmatic quotes on how to cope with rejection, but most don’t do squat if you’ve set your heart on something that does not work out. On the other hand, almost all the people who have had great success in life talk in useful ways about how failure is the better guide to future success. Scientists who spend decades failing to come up with a solution or a cure know that ongoing effort and a commitment to a goal will create change, but it takes patience and time and most importantly acceptance that life is never a linear path. Nassim Taleb talks about developing a self that embraces the ‘anti-fragile’. By this he means that instead of creating walls of protection so that hurt never happens (it will happen no matter what), we should seek opportunities in which we try in new ways to approach a goal, knowing that failure is inevitable in most cases but that it does not need to be taken personally or permanently.  The schools you have applied to may be so interested in certain scores or certain types of students or certain other measures that you have no control over. If you have good grades and research and a way of demonstrating what educators call ‘grit’ then there are places you can go. You may have to redefine which schools are in your range, but then that is not a bad thing. If you go someplace and are a star then other doors will open. The name of the school is not nearly as important as performance. Virtually every educational study supports this.Just this week I heard from someone who graduated from a great university with a 4.0, had great testing, great recommendations, great job experience, and a great personal statement (I have read it), but still got dinged at the ‘dream’ school. I thought the person would be crushed but instead the person said, in effect, "so what". That response alone convinced me that a very bright future lays ahead for the student. Instead of bitterness and blame the student took the news in and said ‘time to move on’. This level of acceptance and focus is rare. I certainly would not have had this reaction, as I would felt that I somehow ‘deserved’ a spot. But does hard work and strong performance mean we ‘deserve’ something? It is the plot we are told, but many people in the world work hard and never have a chance to rise out of poverty or sickness or something bad.  I would advise you to look at other programs, talk with academic advisors and with yourself. Is this a chance to find a new opportunity or path and if so what might it be?  “Don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant’” R.L. Stevenson}}}

Why is it making me anxious?  Really dive into how it makes you feel.  At some point, maybe you'll come to realize that whatever is making you anxious is completely ridiculous and unnecessary.  However, I believe this needs to be a common practice in daily life, and the only way to heal your anxiety,is for you to face it head on and sit with the feeling that it's creating. All to often we feel anxious and don't really dive into what it truly feels like and why it's actually happening.  Be present and aware in this situation.  Ask yourself the important questions, and ponder them through awareness. There are many guides to what we call Mindfulness as well.  To practice and, hopefully, eventually live by, mindfulness will help you get through all pain and suffering. I will not go into depth because of the availability of the information there is out there, but the key is to stay present, always aware.}}}

Treatment is generally separated into medications and behavioral treatments. Both have their place, and medication is not always permanent -- or even often permanent -- for anxiety.In fact, many of the medications are entirely temporary. This is because the medications are addictive, and they don't want  you to get addicted. I took one medication for a day or two, and I couldn't stand it. I took a whole pill and was practically asleep on my feet. Even at a quarter pill, I was too sleepy. I didn't like it and I stopped. In any case, medication can give you temporary relief while you work to implement the behavioral treatments. This can be a great relief. Part of what happens when we are sick is that we have low self worth and don't really think we are worth getting better. So often we punish ourselves by denying ourselves treatments that will help, and by forcing ourselves to rely on treatments we are not capable of at the moment, thus dooming ourselves to continued sickness. The behavioral treatments are pretty standard. Exercise is first and foremost. Do something that elevates your heart rate for periods of time. Get an hour of exercise a day, or more, if you can. Run. Play a game. Bicycle. Whatever you enjoy. But schedule it and make it a daily activity.Exercise, and most of the other suggestions here have an effect on your mind that helps you recover. What they do is stop your conscious mind from chattering so much and allow your subconscious mind to rise above the interior fray. This calms you and helps you appreciate the moment instead of always thinking about the past and worrying about the future.  It doesn't do it all at once. It's a practice. You have to do it for months before you start seeing a benefit. But once it kicks in, you feel much better. This is why taking meds can be helpful in the time before the behavioral interventions start to work.Other things to do are sleep. Go to bed at a regular time. Get 8 hours. In addition, try to eat regularly and eat lots of vegies and fruits. Eat lessmeat. Prepare your own food, and take time to cook things you like. Do not eat prepared foods from the store. Prepare food from scratch. Again, the process of food preparation is meditative and helps your mind calm down, and since you're using better ingredients when you cook from scratch, it is healthier.Do yoga and meditation. These do the same thing as exercise, but work directly on your mind. They are designed to help  you achieve a state of mindfulness where your thoughts are not killing you. They are gone, in fact. Read books about mindfulness. This supports  your other practices, and helps you understand what you are trying to do.See a psychotherapist. Therapy helps you learn coping techniques. It can help with mindfulness and to support what you read in the books. It can help you identify things in your life that trigger anxiety, and figure out how to avoid those situations and cope with the ones you can't avoid.I also suggest taking up a musical instrument or learning to dance. These activities also help you get out of your head and into your body. They calm the anxiety.Anxiety is no fun. I wish you luck.}}}

How many times have you thought, “Oh, if only (fill in the blank) would happen, if only I had (fill in the blank), I would be happy and have no more worries!”On closer investigation though, we can see that these external things – the relationship, children, the stock market – are not truly the cause of the negative emotional states of worry and anxiety.The state we call anxiety is caused not from the external circumstances of our lives, but the internal ‘circumstances’. It is caused by our worrying thoughts.Worry is not an externally caused condition. It is simply a particular type of thought— nothing more.A ‘worry’ or ‘anxious’ thought occurs when the mind projects itself into the future and imagines something going wrong. What is the emotion generated by these types of thoughts or mental movies? Fear.Though these imagined future events are not happening in reality, you are still going through the events in your mind. Your mind cannot tell the difference between your imaginings and reality, so the thoughts have almost the same impact on you as the actual event would!Chronic worry generates states ongoing irritability, muscle tension, concentration difficulties, indecision and agitation just as though you were actually experiencing the things you’re worried about.It results in you being “on edge” all the time and unable to relax (1). Learn to recognize worry and anxiety for what they are. Thought patterns. By doing so they begin to lose their power to ‘take you over’.A Way of Dealing With Worry: Label and Let GoOne technique for dealing with worry proposed by Dr. Christopher Walsh is a technique he calls the “just worrying” labeling (2). It’s a very simple technique: whenever you find yourself worrying about something, note to yourself that you’re “just worrying.”By doing this you become present as the witness of your thoughts instead of being completely taken over by them. You now have the power to choose to let it go.After you label it,  then turn your focus to your breathing, or  just simply bring your attention into the present moment and what your doing. Every time you catch yourself worrying—no matter how often—you employ the technique again.Don’t Fight the FeelingWhatever You Fight, You Strengthen, and What You Resist, Persists – Eckhart TolleFighting our worries is a little like trying to fight the coming storm— no matter how you struggle against it, it just keeps coming. Fighting it only wears you out. The most sensible and energy-conserving thing to do is to settle down and wait it out— for all storms will eventually pass.When using the “just worrying” technique, like any other mindfulness exercise, it is important not to fight your feelings. Don’t criticize yourself for having the feeling, or try to force the thoughts out of your head. In short -don’t struggle with the thoughts.Instead of fighting, observe your worries objectively and calmly. By labelling it “just a worry,” you mentally acknowledge its presence (you become aware of it) without giving it more importance or power than it deserves.You don’t need to waste energy fighting it, but you also no longer follow it and ‘buy into it’. Acknowledge it, label it, drop it, and move on from it.I also highly recommended learning the invaluable skill of ‘mindfulness’ to strengthen your capacity not to be caught up in anxious thinking.I hope this strategy helps you to you to cultivate a beautiful, worry free mind and a happy fulfilling life.Let me know how it goes – I’d love to hear your feedback!LoveMelli1. 9 Steps to End Chronic Worrying2. http://www.mindfulness.org.au/JU...}}}

The first step is to eliminate the triggers. I took the doctor's advice to temporarily leave my job, took steps to control my health problem. Job and health were the triggers for me.I took Lexapro, an anti-depressant that helped me got past my darkest times. Medicine is not the cure, but rather an aid to tone down the anxiety level. It is very helpful in anxiety disorder treatment, but you mustn't rely on it to live.I eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly. I was once a quiet person. But I started talking to people more often.The final step is to follow a method called mindfulness cognitive behavioral therapy. Basically it means I practiced to be mindful of my thoughts and actions at all time, and identify those irrational thoughts that bring about anxiety and actions that enforce the irrational thoughts. I make the commitment to turn them into positive and positive actions that negate the anxiety.I also practiced mindfulness meditation daily to cultivate the calmness in my mind.Lastly. Be patient.

His girlfriend had left him recently and I thik he wanted someone to talk to and releae some pressure. So he called up the girl, set up an appointment and went to see her.He wrote that it helped him a lot! Even his psychologist told him it is a good idea. So he started visiting girls regularly(as much as he could moneywise). With time he met few girls he liked and connected with and became a regular customer. Later he experienced that depressions have returned but it wasn't that bad as before. With time he got better even though he wanted to talk to the girls more than the sex it self. When he talked to those few girls he kind of tapped to their life-is-good energy and started to feel more optimistic about things.I'v read few similar stories so I think that it can help quite a lot to a man. I don't know about the anxiety(I have it too but not that severe) but in my opinion it helps too.A friend of mine went to see a hooker few months ago for the first time and even thogh it didn't go well(first time + the girl wasn't too friendly) he told me that the next day he felt like a superhero(verry confident and hight self-esteem).To sum it up I think sex is one of the most powerfull cure there is for (almost)any psychological problem. I personally don't have a moral problem with hookers and I think that saving a virginity is as stupid as --fill your own stupid belief-- but we are all living in different envirnoments and are affected by different things so eventually it is up to you what you will do with your life.}}}

Amazingly, I discovered that others have dealt with many dilemmas already, and came up with solutions, so just by listening I can get a whole lot of life experience without making the same mistakes.Another thing was the "yes/no" responses that others would give, and then the conversation would just die.So, I stopped allowing others a chance to sit back and let me do the talking by starting the question with, "I need your opinion on this.." and making it a neutral and open-ended question.It appears that people like flattery (asking their opinion is very flattering) and neutral tone would let them show their true colors.

And I am having a panic attack right now. Before the atheism , the idea of god was a common way for me to calm myself down. How should i calm myself about anxiety for the future without again falling back on divine intervention/prayer?I note that you have asked this anonymously. In my experience, yours is not a question asked by most atheists, It is a question asked by theists who do not understand atheism.When you say, "I just turned atheist this year," I wonder what you mean by that. Do you mean that you have come to the realization that you have no belief in any god or gods? Because that is not a "turning," it is a state of being, like the color of your eyes or your height or your sex.Once one realizes one has no belief in any god or gods, it is impossible to "fall back on divine intervention/prayer," because one has no belief that there is anything to intervene or pray to. That's why there are atheists in foxholes (or in battle) and few to no atheists fall victim to deathbed conversions. We simply have no reason to believe it would change anything.If you have anxiety for the future, that could well be an emotional problem quite apart from a lack of belief in any god or gods. You might want to invest in a complete physical checkup, including admitting your anxiety about the future to your healthcare professional. You might also want to consider whether you are in fact atheist. If religious belief is a comfort to you, why did you give it up? Perhaps you're just unhappy with the religion you inherited, or with the people involved, or with someone close to you who is religious. If it makes you happier, by all mean, believe.If, on the other hand, you have arrived at a lack of belief in any god or gods, own it. Use your name. Join the community of Quora atheists. Tell others about how and why you have come to the realization that you have no belief in any god or gods. There are several questions asking about this. If you are experiencing uncertainty about your new situation as a former believer in a godless world, tell about it. Be specific. What makes you anxious? What would lower your anxiety? What support would you like from other atheists? We don't cater to theistic trolls, but we are here for unbelievers.}}}

Before I was an atheist, the idea of God used to calm me down. How should I calm myself in the future without falling back on divine intervention/prayer? }}},{{{Whiskey generally does the trick. That was, as you know, the preferred catharsis of the divine leader of us atheists, Christopher Hitchens (God bless his soul). If it doesn't seem to suit you, you could always try substance abuse, thievery, adultery, or any other similarly relaxing activities. I prefer coveting personally, which, as you know, is very popular among us lawless atheists. Particularly neighbors' wives.In seriousness, I would recommend that you don't look for a way to 'calm yourself down' and face the truth, whatever it is. I use the word in its loosest sense, that is, being true to one's emotions. Don't suppress your fears/anxieties, meet your panic attack headlong and scrutinize it until it appears silly. I find many (secular) Buddhist practices to be useful in this regard, particularly forms of meditation such as vipassana (note: this is not an alternative opiate, it is the very opposite)Essentially, don't run away from it, whether your method be religion or drugs. Panic attacks, though unpleasant, can be very useful and instructive. Even character-building. As another on of our unholy prophets, Friedrich Nietzsche, wrote: What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.Or, of course you could pray for your panic attacks to go away, and worst-case scenario (it actually does kill you) you could hope for an afterlife of eternal joy.}}}

However, there are many steps you can take to ease the pain and slow the process time. I'll share with you what worked for me. 1) go to the doctor. I went to a GP, internist, neurologist, and cardiologist and had a sleep study done. I had about 50 tests run and all showed that I was fine. So the point is you want to make sure there's isn't something physically wrong first. Luckily, mine was not  physical (although it felt like it). Finally the internist prescribed me a healthy dose of Wellbutrin (300 mg) which took about 6 weeks to kick in, but really helped! I didn't know it, but I was depressed and the depression was manifesting itself in these awful moments of terror and doom.2) go see a therapist/psychiatrist. I immediately set up an appointment with a licensed therapist and I have to say I highly recommend therapy! For obvious reasons.......3) exercise. I joined the gym, started going to classes (Zumba, spin, supreme body challenge) and met some really great people! I also lost 50 pounds!4) try to cut out bad habits.     The day I had my first panic attack, I actually thought I was having a heart attack and I called the ambulance! They looked at me like I was crazy when they took my vitals and told me I was fine. Needless to say, the very next day I quit smoking and drinking. I'm too young (31) to feel like I'm having a heart attack so why treat my body this way?5) practice meditation or yoga. This will help you find an inner peace you thought you never had. I promise. I signed up for qi gong, which is kind of like tai chi. I swear this class balanced me and helped calm me down. 6) find a support group. Unfortunately, I didn't have much support during my low period, because my family and friends thought I was faking or overreacting. Honestly I don't blame them! I wouldn't have wanted to be around me either, I was a mess. But I finally had an aunt that really listened to me, gave me advice. She was my only rock during this time. Look for support groups and friends. I guarantee you know someone that is going through the same thing. Or has gone through the same thing and they will have great advice7) do your research. I googled and googled and googled and there are plenty of articles, explanations, people out there that understand/are going through what you are going through. This made me feel better! For a long time, I felt like the loneliest person on the planet. There are apps on the iPhone that help calm you down during a panic attack. These helped me a little, but they could help you more!In conclusion, i never got an answer to why I was having panic attacks. It doesn't run in my family (sometimes it's hereditary) and I didn't have anything major happen (I.e. PTSD) and I finally realized the answer is not black and white! We may never know why this happens to us, but I read somewhere that people who have panic attacks are unique because we have an active imagination, so we really are creative individuals. Try to fuel your creativity into something. I haven't yet found my creative niche yet, but am still looking!Don't give up and I really hope you (and others) read this and it helps!}}}

There are also some good subjective suggestions for handling a panic attack in the moment. I will add my voice to that. Although meditation and other calming activities may help stanch an impending-feeling attack, when things have gone over the line into a full-blown, I have found one thing that can douse it: Anger!Your mileage may vary, and there are many viewpoints on the causes and "pathology" of an attack, but some research suggests that a general sense of passive helplessness is at the root of panic attacks. When in the throes of one, I have found it helpful to reflect on something - anything - that makes me angry. In my case, something that I perceive as unjust usually works. I allow myself to get pissed off, righteously incensed, and to externalize that as much as is appropriate for my surroundings. I clench my fists, curse, scream. It is amazing how this can throw a wet blanket on an attack.Some have success in invoking the mammalian diving response by splashing water on their face, and particularly back of their neck. I also wet my ears. I then stand near or under a fan to get a quick cool-off.Jumping in the shower helps me.I learned early on that I can not go around indignant all the time just to stem panic attacks. The blood pressure would get me on the other end. But in a pinch, it works.I have not had a full-blown attack in over 2 years.}}}

So I let the panic attacks control my life by avoiding putting myself in that situation. I just accepted that this was something that I would deal with for the rest of my life. I hated the fact that I was missing out on things but my fear of another attack was more profound. It was 2 years ago that I had a revelation which seemed to resolve my attacks. Within a 2 month period, I had to deal with the death of my father and my mother's diagnoses of cancer and didn't have an attack once. I realised that if I didn't panic at a time when I was at my most stressed, frightened, vulnerable and emotionally drained then what did I ever need to panic about?I just wanted to share some coping techniques that I found useful:- When you feel an attack coming or in an attack, find something to distract your brain/thought pattern. I found watching a film or going for a drive worked best as it would interrupt my thought pattern.- Tell people in your life about this as they want to help and support you. I didn't practice what I am preaching as I felt silly and weak and wouldn't let anyone know about what I was going through. I didn't want to burden anyone with a shaking, hyperventilating, vomiting, crying mess but my friends and family couldn't bear the thought that I would suffer these attacks alone.- Just go with it. If you want cry, scream, lie on the floor in fear - do it! I used to do whatever made me feel better (in my case, vomiting felt like I was pushing the panic out of my body) and don't feel stupid or weak about it afterwards.I hope that what I have said can give you some comfort that you are not alone and that there may come a day when panic attacks are a distant memory.Good luck and I sincerely wish you the very best.}}}

I have no medical qualification whatsoever.Now, there are two areas we need to think about:How to minimize the impact of a panic attack once you start getting oneHow to prevent them from occurring in the first placeLet's first go with 2 (Prevention):First of all please get the necessary tests done to be certain that the problem is not physical in nature. Any doctor can prescribe you the tests that need to be doneTry to sit and list down all the problems, anxieties that you are facing. Try to see if you can see some cause-effect relationship between them. Are there any specific triggers everytime you get one? Often a lot of our anxieties stem from one or two basic challenges or problems we are facing. Once you identify the root causes, try to tackle them. Ask for help if necessary. The exercise of identifying the root causes will brief some clarity and relief in itself. This exercise is important since panic attacks usually feel like an unknown, overpowering gloom consuming you and once you are aware of your basic anxieties that might be causing those attacks, those attacks will lose the element-of-unknown fearAt the same time, you need to do some breathing exercise daily. Even 15 minutes per day will have a lot of mood-elevating effects. In the initial phase, try to practice twice a day. There are a lot of techniques you can read about online to help you with this (For example, you can try basic Pranayama). The idea behind any of these techniques is to take slow, deep deliberate breaths. If you can meditate with some healing visualizations then that should help a lot too. Be patient with these efforts and with time you will see the differenceIn my opinion, do not take medication unless absolutely necessary. The act of taking medicines itself sometimes can make you feel "there is something wrong with you". If you are under medication, then try to phase those out with help from the doctor, supplementing those with breathing exercises and a healthier lifestyle, which brings me to the next point:Sleep a lot and exercise. Go for a run or hit the gym.Now let's talk about 1 (How to minimize impact if you get an attack)If you are driving, operating machinery etc., then immediately get into a safe position to minimize any potential hazards. It is advisable that you sit or lie down as opposed to standing.Start breathing deeply. Take a long breath, hold, slowly release. And repeat. Do not start panting for breath. Do not hold your breath too long. Do not "forget" to breathe in those overpowering momentsChange your surrounding if you can. Sometimes even a small thing like whistling a tune helps. You basically have to snap out of the vicious cycle of fear from experiencing irrational fear...Please be aware that panic attacks are more common than most of us think. It is neither a handicap nor a limiting factor. If you can address the core anxieties/problems in your life and at the same time lead a healthy lifestyle, you will be able to cope with the attacks easily and eliminate them totally.Take it as an opportunity to detox your life.}}}

If that happens, you experience depression. As your brain shuts down amid this depression, you actually feel less emotion in general and tend to lose interest in various things — including things that may have bothered you previously — and as such you get protected from the psychological stress you were previously experiencing.

From that early experience I found that going from being a happy kid to a depressed kid caused me to feel anxious often, the lack of self confidence and dramatic change in my view of myself and my world caused a lot of bad thoughts which left me anxious about almost every element of my life as well as causing physical changes to me. I don't know if one or the other tends to precipitate the next form of mental disorder but for me, to the best of my memory, depression caused the anxiety as what had been my normality swiftly descended into a world that gave little room for clear thought or just that lovely state of little thought, rather it often left me nearly crippled with a variety of anxieties and at times related panic attacks.}}}

Psychiatry is based on very specific, albeit somewhat arbitrary, criteria.  Mind you, "anxiety" is not a specific diagnosis in medicine, but rather a larger category of diseases.  Same with "depression".If we look at your vanilla anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, we find the following symptoms described (at least 3 of):1. blank mind, or difficulty concentrating2. easily fatigued3. sleep disturbance4. keyed up, restlessness, on edge5. irritability6. muscle tensionIf we look at your vanilla depression disorder, major depressive disorder, we find the following symptoms described (mood low or lack of interest, plus 4 others, for over 2 weeks):1. mood low2. sleep disturbed3. lack of interest in usual activities4. excessive guilt5. energy low6. concentration disturbed7. appetite decreased8. psychomotor retardation9. suicidal ideationI have bolded the symptoms shared by both diseases.  That's how they're related.  End of story.If you want a longer answer, it's that we don't quite know.  We know that the two diseases are often found in the same people, with roughly 50% of those with depression having anxiety and vice versa--given the definitions above, not surprising.  We also know that both respond to treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy as well as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but why this is the case is not exactly clear.The simplistic answer is that both these diseases have to do with deficiencies of the serotonin system and that treatment works for both because we need to fix the "chemical balance" of serotonin in the brain.  The honest answer, though, is that this is not the complete picture (Serotonin and Depression: A Disconnect between the Advertisements and the Scientific Literature).  The theory behind the treatment is still yet to be proven.  So, just because increasing serotonin in the brains of depressed and anxious people makes them feel better doesn't mean that their depression and anxiety is due to too little serotonin in the brain.  This is like saying that since Tylenol makes pain go away, pain must be caused by too little Tylenol in the body.  Instead, lots of evidence suggests depression and anxiety are not simply problems with the serotonin system--for example, injecting people with serotonin does not make them less depressed or less anxious, and many drugs that don't work on the serotonin pathway are useful in depression and anxiety, such as ketamine (an NMDA antagonist and anesthetic agent), benzodiazepines (muscle relaxants), agomelatine (a melatonergic antagonist), and potentially even creatine (a phosphate store), to name a few.}}}

I have anxiety. Ongoing. It's always an issue for me, some times more than others. A couple of times in my life my anxiety combined with extreme circumstances has led to depression - once when we moved to a smallish town and I had no job and no friends and my husband went to work every day and I was just alone, and I also developed post-natal depression later. I am usually a happy, chatty, sociable gal. When my anxiety really overwhelmed me and combined with a set of circumstances I couldn't handle on my own, I withdrew from social interaction, didn't leave the house, turned down help and comfort, everything beyond the basics was too hard and didn't seem worth doing - I was depressed.So for me, in a nutshell, the relationship is that my anxiety can cause depression.}}}

They just cover it up with a stream of words and actions, so that they may forget about their fears for a while. Point being, anxiety does not arise from having this or that inclination, it's more about whether you feel your behaviour is reflecting your desires.Anxiety, for those who are introverted, is wanting to meet new people but finding a room of strangers utterly overwhelming or terrifying. It's wanting to say something but being continually choked up by fears of being shot down or misunderstood. It's where your actions don't translate your inner thoughts, which at its worst can be traumatising.Society outwardly praises extraverted behaviour and so many quieter types can accumulate a sense of guilt from an early age about not being 'open' or 'spontaneous' enough. But it is actually quite possible for a happy introvert to go to a party and be a wallflower, mostly people-watching and having a couple of decent one-on-one encounters. Or to be content with their own thoughts, without needing them continually validated by others in the back-and-forth of conversation. It can be a happy, serene life at times.So the difference between being reserved or anxious is in the quality of your experiences. It's found in the degree of happiness and contentment you discover in your own behaviours.I'm not a psychologist; just an ordinary quiet guy, who sometimes worries about being too quiet, thinking out loud. If you get really torn up about your question, you may want to see a psychologist because anxiety can often be treated quite effectively by changing habits and thought patterns.One last thing: it's easy to use terms like introvert, extravert and social anxiety and forget that they are just words. They may describe part of you, but you are not them.}}}

I'm very shy around strangers.Before we go into social anxiety, we need to know what logic is composed of:LogicObservation: Mindfully noticing objective, observable factsAnalysis: Accurately translating those facts into statementsDeduction: Combing those statements into a solid structure that supports a reliable conclusionThe less a statement in step 2 has to do with an objective fact, the weaker the link is between it and reality.Socially anxious people live in their heads; they skip step 1 and cycle between steps 2 and 3: Analyzing and Deducing. Because of this, they are prone to basing their beliefs on speculations rather than truth.For example, some socially anxious people think they are the prime focus of attention in the room; they don't look around to see if this is true, they just assume it, so every noise and movement they make becomes nerve-wrecking to them, as if they were on a stage. They constantly picture themselves, what they look like in that moment, instead of paying attention to the people they're with or the environment around them.In the case of social anxiety, these flawed beliefs manifest themselves through physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, heavy breathing, tense shoulders, burning eyes, sweaty palms, or a whole host of other symptoms.When I had social anxiety, I strongly believed my eye contact scared people. This conclusion is what I drew in 12th grade whenever I looked someone in they eyes and their eyes started burning; I came away from that, thinking, "Wow, my eye contact must be intense!" I became terrified of looking anybody in the face after that, because I was sure it would disturb or discomfort them.All this was based on the flawed argument: "Because that person's eyes started burning while I was looking at them, I must have scary eye contact." That is to say, I assumed there was NO OTHER POSSIBLE REASON IN THE WORLD for that person's eyes to burn.Then a year ago, I read a book on Logic, and I realized I was missing mindfulness in my life. I realized how my flawed conclusion came about.I began an objective experiment on people when I talked to them. It scared me at first to do it, but after a while it was nothing: I'd look someone in the face while talking to them. If I felt too afraid to go talk to someone, and if my mind screamed out, "You're gonna freak them out," I'd go talk to them anyway, while looking for actual, objective signs indicating whether or not this was the truth.After some time, I realized: There are no signs of it.Think about that. Do you realize how in my head I had to be to live with that belief for 8 solid years, when simple observation indicated otherwise?After I practiced that experiment for a while, my heavy breathing went away, my own burning of eyes went away, my rapid heartbeat faltered... and I settled back in to my true, healthy, vibrant self. Those only went away because the thoughts behind them went away; the thoughts behind them went away because the beliefs behind them became convinced of the truth and changed positions.Despite that, I do feel shy sometimes, though. I'm okay with that. It's due to my high sensitivity, which makes rejection hurt probably a lot worse than for an average person. It has nothing to do with flawed logic; I think it's just the social orientation assumed by highly sensitive people. Once I get to know someone and become comfortable with them, I'm everything that I am.}}}

I am extremely extroverted so when I do get social anxiety it is odd. I think being shy is different but a shy person might get social anxiety to " perform " or have something to say. My husband is kind of shy and he gets massive anxiety sometimes about keeping a conversation going with people. He gets up in his head and starts analyzing too much, then he gets stuck. The conversation loses its' flow and he starts sweatin' bullets lol. I could be wrong but my impression of shyness is someone who doesn't express themselves verbally unless they are really comfortable with you and know you. Social anxiety for a shy person I think is the pressure to be extroverted. For me as an extrovert, I thrive on talking to strangers at a party. I especially love shy people because it's so fun when they start opening up. I get social anxiety with my family because they can be assholes lol. I know when I walk through the door the hierarchy from my childhood will commence and everyone will treat me like I'm 9 years old. So I walk in anxious and irritated I have to be there lol. Just being totally honest. My point is anyone, shy or not, can get social anxiety. If you are generally a quiet person who doesn't express things openly with new people, I would assume you were shy. If you feel real stress when you interact with other people, whether they are strangers or not, I would say you have social anxiety. I think the key factor is stress. Anxiety causes stress, whereas being a shy, more reserved person isn't a stress thing it's a personality trait. The two however can go hand in hand.}}}

An illness is an illness, and if you've got the flu you know you're going to feel terrible for some number of days. You plan for it: you get movies to watch, maybe, or books for bed; you stock up on the things you know you can always eat, and just wait to stop feeling horrible. Note that you don't put pressure on yourself to feel better. If you wake up with a cough at 2:30 AM, you don't weaponize the experience, turn it against yourself. You just say: "I'm awake until I'm done coughing. That's the flu!"I do the same for periods of instability. You're not well; it might last a few days, a week, maybe even more. The most important thing is to slow your life down, take it easy, keep yourself safe from stresses, judgments, tensions, and difficult things, just like you would if you had the flu.Pack a suitcase. When I'm unstable, I have a hard time remembering lessons I've already learned and distinguishing valid thoughts from invalid thoughts. You don't have much bandwidth, memory, or cognitive capacity left over after tons of frenetic interiorized suffering! But some things you must remember:No self-harmSeek help when you need itThis too shall passAnything mental is survivableProgress is possibleI visualize "packing" these ideas into a tiny suitcase, and I bring them with me into the smallest, deepest, darkest places that way. I am never without this suitcase; even when I suffer so much I cannot remember my name, I remember the axioms which "get me through" it, or try to. Spell out the key sustaining ideas, boil them down to nothing, and keep them with you always.When you're fighting off anxiety or despair, have them at the ready. "This is unbearable, it'll never get better," a part of your brain shouts. "No, it is bearable, and it will get better," you calmly recite from your packed list of ideas. The suitcase is useful because —and you must remember this— your thinking isn't sound when you're upset. So you don't want to respect, as it were, any conclusions you draw while miserable; thus you need conclusions to defer to; work them out in advance and remember them as best you can so you don't need to bother with "real thoughts" until you feel better. I literally refuse to think about whether I'm a "good person" while in a state, for example.Get out of yourself. Music, movies, literature, and video games —but not the Internet, which brings with it crowds, social dynamism, people, judgments, stresses— can help with the most basic task: passing time without kicking off that cycle of thoughts that obsesses you. I spend lots of time doing these things so that I'm not always engaged with my own mind.As with the "hunker down" strategy, this strategy accepts as a given that there will be no "relief" from the problem in the immediate future, so you need to keep time moving along without miring again inside your mind. Make a list of books, television shows, movies, and / or video games (or other types of comparable activities: exercise, board games, etc.) that you can do.They should be things you can alone, things which you don't need to do and which you feel no pressure about. For example: don't buy Ulysses and then try to read it during a panic attack and then despise yourself for not being smart enough! Instead, buy comic books, or lighter novels, or whatever you feel like reading. Try documentaries, non-fiction, whatever.Doctors, working out, diet, more pills. I know you're already on meds, but: maybe you need different meds, or more, or fewer. If nothing works, it's important to talk to a doctor. They may recommend changes to your cocktail, more exercise, changes to your diet, and/or much more.The key is to do your best to make progress, but never let yourself get stuck; if you're suffering and stuck and can't use any of these (or other) techniques to get through it, go back to your doctor (or a new doctor) and make sure you keep making progress. That's important, too.If you have any questions, PM me. Take care, and good luck!Edited to add: Joanne Shortell noted helpfully in the comments below that medications themselves can add to instability; in my experience, this is true even of medications that are ostensibly stabilizing! As such, you should make sure you've discussed possible side-effects from medications as a source of your difficulty. There's always the possibility that a minor adjustment (or the substitution of another drug) might make this go away.}}}

In training to be present, you gradually free yourself to be with life rather than beside it. It opens up a space which you can dwell within whenever things get less than rosy. Meditation is the cultivation of a peaceful 'eye' within the storm of life, a perfect respite, a lovely home right in the middle of the maelstrom.Not only does it train emotional resilience but it promotes synchrony between yourself and the world - right now your senses are dulled and you are not in the world, you are in your thought streams. When you practice the cultivation of silence daily, over time you will grow as a person, and become something wholly other than what you are now. True meditation is thoroughly transformative. Check out a guided meditation or two on youtube to get the ball rolling.I hope very much that you find the peace within yourself, friend x}}}

I realize what's happening, think, "I am being ridiculous" but proceed to imagine all scenarios and make them bigger and more crazy, first it's something plausible- like he hits a deer and spins out of control and crashes into a tree.

I can't distract myself or I'll start googling strange diseases and convince myself I've got something.As for depression, same thing. I'm sad, I'm pathetic, nobody loves me, I don't care about anything. Bigger and more ridiculous now- I wish I was never born. (I'm not downplaying the real true feelings here of depression, but we all know as smart people is though we think these things about ourselves, they certainly aren't true) What would life be like if I never existed?

When you become upset from either positive or negative emotions, your breathing will get shallow and rapid which turns on switches in the brain because it listens to the body.  The shallow rapid breathing tells the brain there is some kind of threat.  Controlling your breathing will give you a little space between you and your overwhelming feelings.  That space will get bigger with time and especially with practice.  It may not work for you the first time, that it why it is necessary to try it out several times in order to see if you are comfortable with it.  There are a several different methods of modifying your behavior available to you.}}}

I would like to summarise it with following points:-1. My willpower at peace  did not want me to quit but to move anyway.Frankly speaking, the only choice for me was to continue anyway no matter what because suicide(yes I had these thoughts many times) was not the solution of my problems because I was convinced that these problems would not leave their places even I am absent.2. Just leave everything. That's what I did. I ,at a point of time, just quit everything standing fearless in front of its consequences.

I know its nearly impossible to let it go everything because of these things we are in depression.But believe me YOUR WORLD IS LIMITED BY YOUR MIND.}}}

The type of mood swings and frequency MAY indicate a different diagnosis. The mood swings themselves must be a difficult challenge,let alone the symptoms. I would first recommend an evaluation by a specialist. If you are going to continue with medication, a psychiatrist, if you have not already done so, would be the suggested doctor of choice. If you are currently seeing a psychiatrist it may not hurt for a second opinion. If you are being prescribed medication that does not address the mood swings, it is POSSIBLE you could be on medication that could exasperate the current symptoms.Aside from the suggestion above, I would also recommend seeing what type of pattern, if any, you could see that presents itself. If you journal, you may discover times of day, sleep patterns, or situations that precipitate the symptoms. This may offer you an opportunity to predict and prepare for them.It may be helpful to look at overall lifestyle changes that may help. Diet, exercise, and social pursuits may help.If they are truly random and there is no predictability to them, the next action is to address the symptoms when they do surface. There is a school of thought referred to as mindfulness.  It is a particular approach to coping with difficult emotions or situations. This is different then distracting yourself or thought stopping. It is a technique that trains one to accept and not fight thoughts.  I would suggest doing some research on this for more information. lastly, I would suggest talking to a therapist if symptoms persist. The therapist would be able to provide additional support and guidance to address these symptoms.}}}

If you are staying in bed and not doing anything over    the weekend, stop. Go for a walk, clean up the house,    cook a meal.4. Is there anyone positive in your social environment that can    help, e.g. from church ? It helps sometimes to help    someone else, e.g. give people rides or volunteer at    a foodbank.5.We all have issues such as lack of discipline and self   control, substance abuse, and a lack of perspective.   Do not expect a doctor to fix this for you, it is your   life.6.

So, I'm not a freak? You mean, I was born this way?Personally, I find this incredibly comforting.Now I can stop beating myself up for what I thought was my fault.OK, I still beat myself up, but I do this less now than I used to, before.UNDERSTANDING depression has been useful in re-framing personal relationships, adding a critical layer of context that has helped me heal.Example: my relationship with my parents, whom I spent many years resenting and grieving about "that unconditional parental love I fantasize to deserve but never got".I could have done better with easier parents, but now I realize, my parents could have done better with an easier child than a child like me.I understand now how hard my parents tried. Their intentions were noble but their execution sucked beyond belief.Because I understand how depression works on me, I am able to accept my parents' intentions and forgive their trespasses.AWARENESS of depression has allowed me to live.I'm under no delusion that I'm going to one day "snap out of it", so I stop wasting my time waiting until I snap out of it to do what I want with my life.Most non-depressed people view "a regular day" or "a boring day" as a negative. I've learned to be grateful for having to suffer through a boring day versus suffering through an "I wish I were dead" day.I know I have to work harder than non-depressed people at some things, so I learn to work my butt off when I want to achieve my goals. Because of this, I think I may have achieved more goals than I may have if I weren't depressive.(Apparently many achievements come to people who work their butts off, regardless of their neurobiology.)Depression and I have long embraced in this awkward dance, where I learned ways to avoid depression's stiletto heels stabbing pinning my feet in place.And I ouch am a ouch slow holy shit that one went clear through my foot learner ouch.After a while, I notice how people forget about the scars on my feet and instead, appreciate the way I dance.Not for Reproduction}}}

In depressives, this fear shows up as self-hating beliefs. Perhaps depression is our most honest beckoning to see things more clearly.In my experience of looking for solutions over fifteen years, I found that the conventional wisdom (medication, excercise, simplyfying life and so on) works to an extent, but not permanently.What worked and what I suggest to people, depressed or not (for everyone is burdened by the fear of life):1. Learn a good release technique. The one I use is effective and becomes second-nature quickly: How to Release Big and Small Emotions (Release)2. Do the spiritual inquiry of looking at the sense of I AM. It's described in many works and traditions; but I think currently John Sherman describes it most simply and most clearly. Check out Just One Look. It's that simple.3. Learn to notice what goes on inside.  Observe as a watcher without analyzing or judging. Observe easily without effort. Observe emotion as senations in the body. Observe thoughts. As you observe, thoughts will slow down, become distinct and spaced. Observe the space in-between thoughts.I have to be thankful to the pain of depression for motivating me to look for a permanent solution.}}}

Not one.This is like asking "How has having tuberculosis improved your life?" or "Don't you think your chronic asthma has given you a helpful perspective?" or "What positives has losing your healthy left foot added to your life?" Depression is a nasty, pernicious illness, not a means to self-improvement. It perpetuates itself in part with a seductive tale of self-justification. "I am here because you are smart and perceptive. I make you more empathetic, more self-aware. I help you think more deeply. You will not be creative without me.  I help you see the truth."It is lying.Depression has soured my relationships, destroyed my self-confidence. It has trapped me in a tar pit of despairing inaction. Far from making me more gentle and empathetic, it makes me paranoid, vicious, and defensive. It has negatively affected my education and work. It has confused healthy self-improvement with unhealthy self-destruction. It has made me desperate enough to take medications that make me feel flat and sluggish, like I have a head full of cotton, in order to be a halfway functional member of society.It is as if a shadow has been following me around all my life, and it casts itself over everything I do. Even in times of remission I can feel it lurking in the background. I am terrified of its return.You can be smart, functional, empathetic, self-aware, creative, perceptive, and kind without depression. You are more likely to be all of those things without depression. Don't be seduced by its distorted perspective. Don't listen to its lies.}}}

The truth is that I'm basically running around peering at the world through a toilet paper tube, focusing on random bits of the world. But my experience is one of complete perception and awareness. It's good to be reminded how little we actually can see. (For example: Gorillas in our Midst.)Emotions are the same way. Most people go around generally believing that their feelings mean something about the world around them, not their interior state. That is, instead of saying, "I am uncomfortable around a person who looks different than the people I am used to," they say, "There's something wrong with that guy."Mood disorders can help us see that emotions aren't always meaningful. And that even when they are, they might mean something other than we'd first think. That is an opportunity for wisdom, and I think I have benefited greatly from a reflexive questioning, an ongoing inclination to always maintain a bit of doubt, especially about the things that seem self-evidently true.}}}

I can make guesses about what other people are not saying that are surprisingly accurate, and I can share my experience and I find that other people really relate to it. Depression, oddly, adds a kind of intensity to my life that I sometimes prefer over a flat, ordinary set of emotions. Of course, I'd prefer to be happy, but if I can't be happy, being depressed seems to call out to me. In judicious doses, it can scare me and make me do things. It forces me to change, because if I don't do anything, and I fall into it, I could die. So it definitely makes my life seem a bit more on the edge. Things matter more, even as I am less capable of doing anything about them.}}}

I work in stroke and head injury / neuro rehab where I see a lot of patients and / or family who have issues with mental health.  I think it's made me more understanding of how depression does not just affect your mood, it effects your concentration, memory, etc. When I had the episode of severe depression, I realized what's that my goal is not " happiness" in the traditional sense.. But a sense of " well being" that things will be okay. I actually find it less stressful when I stop worrying if I am " happy.". Thats probably me and my own issues, but sometimes focusing on being happy sometimes is counterproductive.Not being depressed means I feel connected to people and things, I don't feel apathetic, I feel meaning in life.}}}

Some phrases which would have accurately described me back then was: smart-ass, over-confident, arrogant, short-tempered and "ego the size of a small planet". A series of hard rejections, both on the social and professional fronts, struck me within a short time span and I dropped into a steep depression. I became socially isolated, I'd cry to myself time and again, and I wanted to end it all. This went on for a little more than a year before I got out of it.Three years later, no one I meet today believes me when I tell them that I was once short-tempered or arrogant. Heck, even those who knew me before my depression tell me that they couldn't believe how much I'd changed after it.So yes, depression is terrible and I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy.

However, concerning my passion as a musician creating music I find myself delving into this dark despair almost unconscious of the act and the release of emotions manifested from such pain. All that hurt that I suffer from 24/7 transforms into something beautiful and comforting like the scent of summer rain or the ocean waves washing ashore. Despite the mood of the song it becomes mentally tangible granting me control and reprieve over the hell that has haunted my life whilst awake or in my torturous dreams.}}}

It's taught me that happiness is completely unrelated to things usually associated with happiness - things like money, success at work and success romantically. Happiness is really just about you and about making sure that you do the things that make you happy.edit - I just read the part in the question about this acting as inspiration for someone -This is what I do.I think about what I'm thankful for. I really try, even if I can't. Except I don't just 'think' it, I try and 'live it' - I try and remember a specific experience I am thankful for and really 'wallow' in it. Once I got good at that, I started to just skip that step - it got to a point where just thinking about a friend, or a sentence would result in that same feeling and it would counter my depression. I tried to figure out who I wanted to be in life and I really tried to make everyday about getting to being that person. A lot of that was to do with being a more compassionate, empathetic person, so I really look for opportunities to help people(whether it be through checking up on a friend - we do this so rarely these days, or by helping an old woman cross the street with her groceries).  Some of this was to do with programming - I became depressed because I had given up working part time, so I found another job. I had also been extremely physically fit before and the depression had stopped me from working out - I started to force myself to go workout, and after a week things got better. The emphasis that I'll put here is on being thankful - if you're thankful for what you have, you're instantly more happy. That's the specific 'thought' that I go to in order to counter my depression. I came to do that after trying a lot of different 'thoughts'. I used to try actively fighting it - refusing to be sad...but that took too much energy and was self fulfilling(try to not think about something - it's impossible). I used to imagine it as  a rock coming at me, and my punching through it - but that wasn't good enough in certain situations(like when I was drunk). When I was at my weakest, I imagined it as a tornado in my head, with me barely hanging on. It's hard to do what I'm suggesting - you really need to find out what makes you happy. No, don't just say nothing - you've been happy before - think about those times and figure out what made you happy then. This was the list for me -I'm thankful for the fact that I'm driven.I'm thankful that I have friends who will come see me if I'm in trouble and who will come see me straight away and that I have a  lot of them.I'm thankful that I have a job that I like.I'm thankful that I have a purpose in life. I'm thankful that I'm the sort of person who won't run from someone else who's suicidal.And a month ago I added this -I'm thankful that I'm the sort of person who can beat depression.}}}

Utterly and totally overwhelmed. There was either continuing at the current pace or cutting to the bone my commitments - the latter had a glimmer of hope embedded into it.So, cutting it was.Those dozens of extracurricular classes for my child had to go, the constant "I am responsible for..." had to be delegated (who knew that I was a perfectionist freak?), things like bill pay and grocery delivery were automated/scheduled as well. My thinking became that if god takes me today, the household will be able to move on (yes, I was at my wit's end trying to make it all work on my own).I also realized that I was trying to keep too many things in my head -the appointments, the account numbers, the phone numbers, addresses (yes, it sounds too silly reading it now); so I consolidated all the information in my iPhone and regularly back it up to retain data.At a moment's notice, I know what is where and when - and most importantly, I learned to let it go. So, if a 4th (just today) birthday party is missed, the world won't end - there will be another birthday party to go to.I also cut down on my friends - went through the list and left only the quality ones: the ones whom I can call at 3am with an emergency, and they will actually show up to help me (and I will do the same for them).It appears that those are single digits, and not 100s like my phone contacts listed. Who knew?My weekends are free now, there is no burden of having to run somewhere because I was late, I can actually plan my life now.I am spending more time with my child - face-to-face time - instead of talking to the rear-view mirror in the car while hurrying from swimming classes to dance classes.I got my life back!And all of this thanks to the depression when my mind and my body told me that enough is enough, and I cannot go on in the same "Let's schedule this!" mode.}}}

Well, at least you won't see any. Nothing registers. Jokes, happiness, joy - NADA. But, anything sad or upsetting has the power to further you in the tentacles of depression. You start questioning everything - your emotional strength, your mental capabilities, intentions of people and your self respect goes for a toss. You are trapped by it, but eventually it starts to dawn upon you that it has the power to liberate you.When I say liberates you, I mean not from the depression itself but from the very feelings or associated yet unrelated feelings that caused it. You see, depression is like hitting rock bottom. It can get worse no doubt, but at every stage you feel like you have hit rock bottom and then something bad happens, and you descend further into this hell.Now, let me introduce you to two powerful quotes whose gravity you comprehend when you are in that depressed state of life and see no way out."And why do we fall, Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves up." ~ Batman Begins"It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything" ~ Fight ClubEvery person is different. So, I will just talk about my tryst with it. I was depressed. Fuck, I think I still am. Past 5 months have been the worst of my life. But, when I look in retrospect, I think it was sort of required. Depression acted as a kick in the shins for me. Woke me up from the dream I had become comfortable in and showed me, that effects of that self-administered blue pill don't last. As I said, I think I maybe still in the throes of depression, but I feel, clarity that has been evading me for so much time, is starting to return. I sense that. I don't know if it's real or will it last, but somehow I see the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. For all I know, it can be another train headed in my direction. But, that dreaded return of state isn't somehow stopping me from trying to learn as much as I can about myself, my strengths and weaknesses.I saw my mistakes. I understood how my little actions and inactions can cost a lot. This all comes in retrospect, but it does. That I suppose is the only benefit of suffering one. It has made me more mature than I was before, more considerate of others as well as returned me my focus on my career that I had lost for so long. Like all things, this depressive state will come to an end. I hope it does. And, if I am unable to learn anything from all this, then you can be sure, if those circumstances are to repeat again, I would be as unprepared as I was before and definitely, will be more entrenched in depression than ever before. You lost a battle. Yep, shit happens. Life's unfair so no use cribbing about why it happened to you. But, this is not the only battle I am going to be a part of. There will be countless other and I am not going unprepared anymore. This depression showed me the chinks in my armor, well it showed me that I had no armor at all. A naked guy running around in a blazing world with no protection for oneself and careless as fuck.So you do learn. It takes time for the realizations to dawn upon you. It takes effort to break out. I have a lot of help. I can't express my gratitude to my closest friends for helping me out here. You need friends to battle it out. A fight like this, will make you a better man, will strengthen your relationships with people and most importantly, you will be free. And, this freedom comes at a price my friend. You have paid the price. Either you can let it go to waste or milk as much as you can."Get busy living or get busy dying."P.S. I was gonna make it anonymous. But fuck it.}}}

A great deal of communication is non-verbal, especially at places like universities and offices where it's often more important to be polite than honest.Here's an example. I've just met a new person at work and I'm talking to him about what I do. He's standing like this.His body language immediately tells me that something's wrong. He's standing very straight, so he's not at all relaxed. His arms are crossed, forming a barrier between me and him. His mouth is shut tightly, so he can't smile or talk. He's staring straight at me and his eyes are very 'dead' - there's no life or joy in his gaze.Yikes! I've either really annoyed this guy or I'm boring him to death. I'd better shut up or ask him a question to get him talking.These are also techniques that I can use if someone's boring me. I don't want to say "you're an idiot", because that would be rude! But I can signal to him that I want him to shut up and go away in lots of non-verbal ways.I can cross my arms, start tapping my feet, turn away from him, sigh deeply, start using my phone or - my personal favourite - gaze up at the ceiling. I might do this for several minutes before I'll eventually crack and say: "Sorry, I have to go now".Body language and non-verbal communication is very complex and not easy to understand if you can't naturally read people.

Apart from being a book about body language, he has also provided illustrated explanations from a physiological and psychological point of view of why people respond to a certain situation in a certain way. According to Mr. Navarro, 90% of all human communications is non-verbal and the body constantly communicates feelings through physical symptoms. Contrary to popular belief, one must never base someones eye or face to judge their intentions. He argues that human beings are social animals and lying has always been a part of society. The ability to lie, create imaginary situations or planning is due to our sophisticated Pre-Frontal cortex. The development of the Pre-Frontal cortex is the reason why humans were able to move out from caves into skyscrapers. While the Pre-Frontal cortex is impressive in its ability to judge, plan, decide it is also very slow. This usually spelled disaster for our cave dwelling ancestor. The snapping twig that you heard behind you could have been a sabre tooth cat or could have been a mouse. This indecision would usually result in death for our ancestors. The concept of scaring your friends or public embrassment was starkly absent during the pre-historic days.However, the Limbic system which comprises of the Amygdala is an rudimentary evolutionary left over from our pre-human days and is the seat of self preservation instincts. It was responsible for our flight or fight mechanism. While the Limbic system is inaccurate compared to the Pre-Frontal Cortex in its result, it is also very fast in making on spot decisions. This ensured that our ancestors bolted when they heard a twig snap or a leaf rustle instead of pondering over whether it was a predator or the wind. This in turn ensured that our ancestor could go on to find a mate and propagate their genes.Fast forward 50,000 years and little has changed. The limbic system is now relegated to giving you a mini heart attack everytime a car backfires or you catch a slight movement in your peripheral vision in a dark alley.Remember the time when you involuntarily screamed and covered your eyes when your friends jumped at you from the dark, that is the Limbic system in action.Coming back to Mr. Joe Navvaro's claim that human beings are social animals and that lying is a part of human thought process. We have developed an uncanny ability to hide obvious or exaggerated physical cues on our faces when lying. He adds that an individuals face is the mask that one wears in public and that judging someone according to their facial cues usually lead to inaccurate results.He advises that the body, namely the hands, feet, torso position provide much accurate results. When someone is tense or feels slightly threatened, the face remains placid, but the hands and feet cue us of the real intentions thanks to the Limbic system. Breathing slightly increases, fists clench, the feet start pointing away from the aggressor. For example, when you get on a crowded bus, look at the passengers faces, they are placid, listening to music, playing with their phones. But, when you look at their feet, you will find that many people face their feet (atleast one feet) towards the exit. This is a non verbal cue of their intentions to get off the bus. Human beings have a comfort zone of atleast 3 feets around their body. When a trusted individual (like family or friends) breaches that zone, there is little or no reactions. However, in a crowded place filled with strangers, there are going to be reactions when that zone is breached. Another example of non verbal communication is when you are in a waiting roomis that many people cross thei... (more)Loading...}}}
/How-does-Xanax-work-/Will-Giardino,/How-does-Xanax-work,/Will-Giardino,6 Feb,3,{{{/Ayon-Nandi}}},{{{Anxiety, Drugs and Pharmaceuticals, Mental Health, Xanax}}},Anxiety,{{{How does Xanax work? }}},{{{Xanax is a benzodiazepine. "Benzodiazepine receptor" is a commonly-used term that refers to a specific form of the GABA-A receptor that is comprised of multiple distinct subunits and responds to benzodiazepine compounds. Only select configurations of GABA-A receptor subunits form the type of GABA-A receptors that respond to benzos.When Xanax interacts with the benzo-sensitive GABA-A receptor, this causes a physical, conformational shift in the GABA-A receptor that allows it to better interact with its endogenous ligand, GABA. By facilitating interactions between GABA and the GABA-A receptor, Xanax increases the flux of chloride ions through the cellular membrane, thereby inhibiting the cell.Benzodiazepine's behavioral effects are primarily mediated by GABA-A receptor signaling that occurs within the brain. Benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA-A receptors are found on many types of neurons, but not necessarily GABA-containing neurons themselves. In fact, a primary mechanism underlying Xanax's sedative effects is through inhibition of excitatory neurons, rather than through inhibition of inhibitory, GABA-containing neurons. However, if GABA-mediated inhibition occurs on GABA-containing neurons, this could result in a form of net excitation termed "disinhibition." Disinhibition of mesolimbic dopamine circuitry is a potential mechanism underlying potential reward-related effects of benzodiazepines.}}}

Good sleep hygiene, carefully structuring my day so I'm calm by bedtime, plenty of bright natural light in the bedroom, and probably a lot more I've forgotten.Lots of sunlight - Being near windows when I'm indoors, spending more time out of doors. In the cloudy parts of winter, I supplement with a blue-LED panel.Low use of drugs (which, yes, includes coffee) - I have caffeine about once a week, and alcohol maybe twice a week. I'm especially careful with red wine, which seems to have a much stronger aftereffect on my moods than beer or spirits.Frequent, vigorous physical exercise - Running, cycling, and hiking definitely stabilize my moods and make me more relaxed. A short run is nice, but I get the most mood benefit from things that last more than an hour.Yoga, massage, steam - Being anxious makes me tense up. Tense muscles make me anxious. I break that cycle by really relaxing the muscles.Minimal refined carbs - I don't know why, but the more sugar and white flour in my diet, the more prone I am to mood swings.Supplements - My doctor recommended a B-100 and a sublingual B-12 daily to minimize the effects of stress. If I skip them for a while, I really notice. I also take fish oil, which studies show helps with depression.A quiet home - I used to have loud upstairs neighbors, and their presence created a continuous baseline of anxiety that made it harder to deal with other things. Having a quiet refuge makes it easier to recover from the stresses of daily life.Meditation - The practice itself makes me calmer. But the real benefit for me was in learning to treat my moods like weather: something to endure but not worry about. I used to get anxious about being anxious, and depressed about being depressed.

Understand the cause:Let me preface my answer by stating that depression is an advanced form of anxiety gone untreated or mistreated, so I will talk about how to treat anxiety. Once you do, your source of depression should get cut off and it should slowly vanish.Like with most "mindbody disorders", Western medicine fails to address anxiety and depression adequately because of misdiagnosis. Medicine expects all human body conditions to be chemically caused. This is a fallacy. And this fallacy causes doctors to confuse chemicals as the cause of anxiety and depression as opposed to its effect. Therefore, when you go to a doctor, you end up being prescribed medication for anxiety and depression. Only for a few conditions this makes sense. For majority of the conditions, this is simply misdiagnosis and mistreatment. Medicine treats the effects of anxiety and depression, not its causes.Anxiety is a mind condition most frequently (with some brain-atrophy exceptions) caused by cognitive disorders. Simply stated, during your life time, through observation of certain events, you come to take certain "rules" for granted through thinking and belief. These rules might be observations such as "I'm never good at attracting a partner" or "I'm always last at my workplace / school", or "I never get a break". Your brain will then take these cognitive observations and use them to chemically optimize your body's processes to live up to the observed challenge. For example, when you're thinking "I'm always last", your brain kicks your heart into gear, which will make you sweat, because you brain wants you to run and be first -- even though in reality, it's not a physical match but a proverbial match in which you're last. Or when you say "I never get a break", your body tenses up and you become angry, because your brain is gearing you up to finish your job faster to catch a break, even though you meant "I never catch a break in life".Cognitive distortion:The subtlety of cognitive disorders (of which anxiety is one) is that we end up not realizing the transition of these one-time personal or social observations into automatic subconscious thoughts. In other words, your brain is usually so smart that it can automate things for you, for example, when you discover how to stabilize yourself on a bike -- and it does the same thing for repeated observations: it starts saying the sentences in the back of your mind, without you having to use your mouth! It's critical for you to realize this: you're actually saying things to yourself in the back of your mind, without so much as a peep.The key hack to completely reversing anxiety is to train yourself to stop the moment you're having anxious feelings and realize this: You're not having anxious feelings. You're having anxious thoughts. The distinction is night and day: feelings are treated by chemicals, vitamins and hugs. Thoughts are treated by thinking correctly.Here's the kicker: The subconscious part of your brain, which is responsible for automating your thoughts and forming your personality, has evolved a long time ago. So long ago in fact, that it's childish in its level of intelligence. You let it hear from you "Gosh, why can't I catch a break in life" and its childish response is to think "Oh! Master is tired. Master needs a break ... let me turn on ALL the machines under my control to get everything done as quickly as possible so master and I can catch a break together." BOOM - your heart is suddenly in high gear, your muscles are tense or otherwise fatigued, you're hyper-ventilating, you're having a panic-attack and eventually if this pattern repeats itself frequently enough, you're giving up on life completely and going into depression. Why? Because the subconscious brain has the IQ of a moron,... (more)Loading...}}}

I tried a very low dose of Prozac briefly (it didn't have much effect, and I stopped because I was scared by the evidence of neurological damage cited in Prozac Backlash), and have considered going back to a higher dose, but these practices have gotten me to the point where it's really not a high priority for me.A Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy approach, as detailed in Amin Ariana's excellent answer, got me a lot of mileage, as a lot of my anxiety stemmed from a tendency to be overly self-critical. 2 important caveats, in my experience: (1) It can be difficult to do in your head, as automatic thoughts are very persuasive. What works for me with CBT is to head to a journal ASAP (kept in a Word document) and follow the strategies Amin lays out in writing. (2) If you have a lot of anxious thoughts and feelings, it can be counterproductive as it mires you in that anxiety all the time.Over the last year I've taken a much less cognitive approach to anxiety, which has had a HUGE impact. I still occasionally head to my journal when anxiety is strong, but most often, I rely on the following techniques:1) Mindfulness - the state of being present to and accepting of whatever arises. In brief, presence orienting towards living in the present moment, only visiting the past or future when necessary (which is much less often than you'll think). Acceptance means letting yourself feel whatever emotion you're feeling, then choosing to let go of your attachment to the way things are. Mindfulness meditation is very powerful for cultivating this mindset. It also helps cultivate a sense of your self as the observer behind your thoughts and emotions, which helps you just kind of "sit" with the anxiety rather than being engulfed by it. Some relevant resources are noted here: What are the best resources for cultivating mindfulness?2) Intense exercise. I find that 15 minutes of at least moderate intensity cardio makes a HUGE difference in how anxious I feel. (I do some combination of dance / aerobics in my bedroom every morning, but lifting weights works for me too.)John Ratey's book Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain goes into scientific detail about the importance of exercise in combatting anxiety (as well as other benefits), but reading the book won't really help you combat anxiety from a practical POV.3) The breathing exercise mentioned here helps me reduce anxiety in a particular moment, though it often makes me slightly sleepy: What are the best body hacks that people should know about?Hope that helps! Anxiety can really suck.}}}

Surround yourself with people who are supportive. You can find hundreds of forum boards online filled with people who understand what you're going through and are glad to help you. Recognize that you are not "crazy", and that anxiety is a disorder that affects millions of people.

Mindfulness is there in order to recognize. To be mindful of something is to recognize that something is there in the present moment. Mindfulness is the capacity of being aware of what is going on in the present moment. "Breathing in, I know that anger has manifested in me; breathing out, I smile towards my anger." This is not an act of suppression or of fighting. It is an act of recognizing. Once we recognize our anger, we embrace it with a lot of awareness, a lot of tenderness....We practice taking care of our anger in the same way. Mindfulness recognizes anger, is aware of its presence, accepts and allows it to be there. Mindfulness is like a big brother who does not suppress his younger brother's suffering. He simply says, "Dear brother, I'm here for you." You take your younger brother in your arms and you comfort him. This is exactly our practice.This has been deeply healing practice for me. Anger still remains, but has certainly diminished.If you are interested in learning more, have a look at these resources:Anger: Wisdom for Cooling the Flames: Thich Nhat Hanh: 9781573229371: Amazon.com: Books1.

You should learn how to externalize it positively. There are many ways to do it but taking into consideration that we all are unique beings, the closest to perfect formula varies from one being to another. I.E. When I get really angry I take a walk, a drive, or do some excercise to release stress and later go and talk to whom I got angry at or fix whatever went wrong that triggered my anger.I believe through my experience that in order to learn how to really deal with anger you must first learn, feel and experience what does having someone angry screaming at you or externalizing it on you feels like. You should also think deeply on how your anger issues affects the people around you. In essence, how many people, life events and things do you alter by a miserable reaction (anger) worth less than a grain of sand when you could instead affect it on ways were your reactions can be of good use for others.}}}

What is the purpose?" Typically, the first response from yourself will be something about the external.Then ask "How is the anger going to accomplish that purpose? IS it going to accomplish its purpose at all?" If not, then the anger is untrue, and is hiding something else. Knowing it is untrue, it makes less sense to act on it and so there's more motivation not to.So ask again, "Why is this anger arising?" That is, "What is this anger revealing about myself right now?" By identifying the internal misalignment causing the arisal of anger, you get a hold of what needs to be worked on.From there it gets more particular to context. You just need to search, going deep as you need to find what you can act on to negate, rather than vent, the anger.}}}

But when I do, it's usually bad because i just take a final decision about them and move on. i'm trying to get out of this behavior.i stop communicating until i feel i can handle the conversation. i work with pure logic until i can process emotions. i never take blame for something that's their fault. i go and talk to the people who made me angry instead of anyone else and i make sure they listen. if they are not capable of doing that, i'll simply ditch them. i'm basically a cold-anger person. you seem to be more of a 'hot-headed' person. i was like that, long before,but now it has changed and i'm more likely to internalize the anger.

Rather I felt relief after bursting out and I used to justify myself for being honest in expressing my feelings.Later, I had more friends including my husband who doesn't speak harsh words when they get angry. This helped me in two ways, one is that I didn't have opponent who is shouting at me when they are angry (which in turn will make me shout at them), second is that I got inspired on how they deal with it (even when there is disagreement, they try to speak/express their views and not force it on me).So, the solution I found is, be with people who don't shout/fight unnecessarily, learn from them. With time, this will become your habit, even with others you will be able to talk with patience, but to begin with, you should be with people who knows anger management!}}}

Where some might see an environment of danger, others may find some measure of personal reward in that same environment. Anger is a product of fear. Usually, the fear of loss or injury; emotional and otherwise. We emotionally connect to experiences we view subjectively. But we find it easy to disconnect emotionally when we find the means to view a situation, or event, objectively. This new perspective would give you a new angle on the situation or event, allowing you to decide how to feel about it.“Everything you see or hear or experience in any way at all is specific to you. You create a universe by perceiving it, so everything in the universe you perceive is specific to you.” – Douglas AdamsIf you can find a perspective that allows you to objectify the situation(s) or event(s) that you're angry over, then you'll be able to analyze the scene from a more emotionally intelligent position.I wish you the best.Respectfully,Aaron AustinOwner, Founder, Prison-bustin'-Jailbreaker!Be Younified!

I have similar issues but have pursued a path of recovery.The #1 thing that will affect whether you can recover, and whether those closest to you can continue to be close, is your willingness to seek help.  Pride?  Control?  If you can let go of these, your prospects are good.In the details you provided, you indicated you'd prefer a solution that didn't involve medication.  I completely understand - I pursued a recovery process successfully for many years before taking medication.  At the same time, I have to advise that a good family doctor can lead you to the right medication and the difference they can make, can be like night and day.  This can be most apparent to those around you.Doctors can also be helpful in giving directions to services in your local area such as twelve step fellowships, counselling and other therapies - these are long term activities that can change the way your brain works.  (It did for me.) Most importantly they give you access to therapeutic community - friends who really know what it's like.  Their experiences can really help you.  And isolation is rarely good for the soul.The common thing about everything I've shared, is that they are all intended to make your life easier, happier, better.It can be counter to your instincts to do some of these things - fear has become so dominant in your thinking.  But you've let fear control you for a long time.  One way to look at the next couple of months is: What have you got to lose?Adding your question was an incredible step forward against the current.  Now, you have everything to gain by following up your question with more great steps forward.}}}

Imagine an ideal parent loving you completely-- and unconditionally.  What would that parent say to you when you begin feeling anxiety or fear? S/he would say you are wonderful. That you must be gentle with yourself. S/he would wrap you in an embrace and call you Baby, murmuring to you, stroking your cheek. You would sink into this beloved parent, safe and protected by love. That unconditional love which we learn to associate with parental sufficiency may be lacking in your emotional toolkit. It is up to you to develop the image and the feeling of relaxation and sufficiency that this image / meditation brings. It will, if practiced, give you the ability to fill in childhood's emotional gaps. No child feels calm and well-adjusted without feelings of sufficiency. Instead, panic and anxiety replace sufficiency born of calm, because we are always worried, always seeking, always afraid without that sufficiency. That calm is a balm for all humans. Religious and spiritual people think of this as a parental blessing, but however you think of it, it is what a sweet baby needs to feel safe and loved. No matter what you did, no matter what your thoughts may have been, no matter how rage-filled or confused you may be, or how much regret you have for past actions, the past does not equal the future -- and, if you can focus all of your energy on creating emotional sufficiency through imagery of an ideal parent in any moment of anxiety, you will arm yourself for the world's slings and arrows in a non-defensive and welcoming way.That is, you will feel yourself loved, and able to love -- everything and everyone. Because you will feel there is enough goodness in the world to share it.}}}

Worried about everything, everything, school - though I was very smart and school was easy - I cried with worry about how I was doingfriends - though I made some good ones. Was always troubled if some didn't like me etc.Home life - it was okay - there were troubles - but not as many as I made.Everything seemed fraught with disaster - everything had the potential for doom.I self medicated with street drugs for a long while - actually worked too - but the downside side effects were enormous and damaging I also went through many painful emotional episodes where I tried to  assign blame outside myself - he didn't treat me right.  I had to worry  about you, I needed to be 'geared up' to deal with this or that.  Every breakup from age 14 to 35 was devastating and always all my fault. Any failure, at school or work - would destroy my confidence for weeks.It was all false.None of which helps but I wanted you to know you are not alone by any means.On the other hand, Christopher Rubin and David Urquhart offer you good alternatives or additions.1) You show you understand it is not 'natural' or 'required' or 'appropriate to the situation'.2) See if counseling can help you. It won't cure you but it may give you tools and techniques to help you manage.3) Breathe Man Breathe! - whatever you are experiencing doesn't need to be acted upon immediately - and as you said, you are often aware you're overreacting.  Give yourself the break of space and time.  Rest on the decision.  Go to your happy place :D - learn to breathe to relieve the need for immediate activity.  I recommend http:\\doasone.com - for many reasons - this is one.4) Forgive yourself - it makes it worse if you are beating yourself up each time you go off the anxiety rails and run around being ... well ... crazy.After you stop - breathe - rest - follow the suggestions in other answers and try again.  - Get used to the idea you are an anxious person - for me - and yes even medicated me - I now tell people - easily and openly ...e.g. "Look, I may be over reacting, I can get really worked up.  If I'm talking too fast or too loud or I'm not making sense, just let me know.  - If they do, I have learned to stop, listen and wait, before I do anything.It has also helped (not cured but helped) me to take these thoughts all the way down the line - Okay - Gary - so if that is true, than this will happen and then I'll deal with that and then this will happen and so and so on until the world explodes (just kidding) Once part b - doesn't happen - I can reflect that I am 'over - worried' and I can give myself a break.Reach out for help. Good luck and peace be with you.}}}

And much of the 1% is beyond our control. You can't manage all the variables and tumbling over them again and again in your mind doesn't change the outcome. Not recommending that you not look at risks and use good judgment to try to mitigate them. But the churn you describe is an outlet for undefined anxiety. I think the best book on the subject with real pragmatic advice is Dale Carnegie's How To Stop Worrying And Start Living. From Wikipedia:How to stop Worrying and Start Living is a self-help book by Dale Carnegie. It was first printed in Great Britain in 1948 by Richard Clay (The Chaucer Press), Ltd., Bungay Suffolk (S.B.N. 437 95083 2). It is currently published as a Mass Market Paperback of 352 pages by Pocket (Revised edition: September 15, 1990), ISBN 0-671-73335-4.Carnegie says in the preface to How to Stop Worrying and Start Living that he wrote it because he "was one of the unhappiest lads in New York".

I dealt with anxiety myself for 2 years of high school and overcame it in the summer after high school.I will say what worked for me and the philosophy behind the approach I took.I did not want to take medication because I did not want to deal with side effects or deal with the symptoms of my condition. I wanted to deal with the underlying factors causing the condition of anxiety that I got myself into .Originally I really knew nothing about my condition or why I was feeling the way I did. I had head tingling and panic attacks without really knowing what they were so I ended up just doing some research online to become more knowledgable about anxiety in general.I came across a website called AnxietyCentre.com which really was the breakthrough for me.I learned that anxiety was a combination of both physiological and psychological factors that can't be resolved independently but jointly. I learned that anxiety and stress are related. Anxiety causes stress and stress causes elevated anxiety. To kill anxiety it is important to tackle the physiological and psychological factors that lead to anxiety and stress.To tackle the psychological issues, you would want to discover what in your life is causing you to be anxious. What thinking patterns do you have that irritate your anxiety? For example , your thoughts may always be worrisome and fearful about whether or not you will lose your job. These thoughts and worries create the anxiety that you are experiencing. You'd want to work on changing your thoughts with a kind of technique called "stopping and swapping". Whenever you have trouble with a fearful or worrisome thought, you are going to want to stop that thought and swap it with a more rational or balanced thought.If you currently think, "omg I am going to lose my job" , then you'll want to swap that with "I have no reason to think that because I am a good employee who isn't going to be laid off"These thoughts can be fears about anything and what you need to do is change your brain's thinking patterns and reaction to the stimuli that make you have a fearful or worrisome response . Calm thoughts lead to a calm brain. Also if there are things you fear that you are avoiding you need to experiment with exposure therapy which gets you to expose yourself to the stimulus you are fearful about  instead of continuing to avoid it . In my case of anxiety, I would not leave the house for about 2-3 months due to being anxious about driving a car. I would have this weird feeling come upon me that the road was getting longer and that other cars were going to drive into me. I know it was irrational but it was something my brain was doing to me at the time. So instead of letting this continue to affect me, I went about driving as much as I could to train my brain to dissociate the stimulus of driving to the reaction of the fear of the road getting longer and the cars driving into me. So basically, it's up to the individual to identify their own faulty thinking and associations and work at changing them. That is how you'd solve the underlying factors and causes of your condition of anxiety.Next is the physiological factors and this would include nutrition, exercise and meditation. Now I did not go all out on the nutrition other than trying my best to eat 3 solid meals per day as well as drinking enough water. I took a multi vitamin which helps with general functioning of the body and mind ;and fish oil which is said to help the brain. I truly believe the multi and fish oil helped me to stay feeling well physiologically. On the exercise portion, I would try to exercise for 20 minutes a day at least. Even if it is as simple as taking a walk around the neighborhood , you should just do it. Nothing will stop you if you get in the habit of exercising. Walking, running, cycling, even some weight lifting can help to alleviate anxiety. Some advise against very heavy weights for anxiety but  see what is right for you.I would then also say that meditation or deep relaxation techniques are the real anxiety killer. Anxiety gets your body and mind overstimulated and over-active. The way to reduce this overstimulation is to do any of the many meditation or relaxation techniques out there. Try mindfulness meditation which involves simply paying attention to your breath for a period of time (10-45 minutes works). There's deep breathing where you in breath for 7 seconds through your nose and out breath through your nose for 7 seconds. You'll want to make sure your stomach is moving when you breathe and not your chest. Again , there are may different techniques out there for you to investigate so just try each one out for yourself.This approach of attacking physiological and psychological causes is at the root of the very popular cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). I'd suggest trying to get a therapist of you can afford one because it can end up being very beneficial to you !!**This isn't to say there are not other techniques or other ways to approach dealing with worry and anxiety but its pretty much what helped me to get rid of my anxiety (fully overcame it).**Thanks for reading and I hope it helped. It isn't very in death stuff but just a brief answer on how to overcome anxiety without medication. You will overcome it if you overcome your worries and fears . It is that simple.}}}

It has just become so exhausting in recent years, worrying about multiple things a day - how I looked at someone, something I said, something that I did that someone may have misinterpreted.  I made a list today and found out I was nervous about six separate occurrences from when I woke up to 5pm.  I'm normally very outgoing, charming, and social.  I still am.  But I'm very worried I'm headed down a very lonely and isolative path.  I want to stop, but it's almost as if I'm addicted to being anxious - that if I don't think about something enough or torment myself about it enough, then it may happen and I'll be sorry.  I'll also sometimes just comb over my past, resurrect things that happened months or years ago and begin to worry about them.  I sometimes fear that other people have the power to destroy me, and it makes me feel so weak.  I'm afraid all of this great human potential inside of me will be wasted for fear that my past decisions/actions will come back to harm me. I'm just so tired.  I have done therapy, mindfulness, and read lots of books, and I know that I can/should/will do more.  I tried anxiety meds in the past, but they just didn't seem to have any effect and I don't really think I want to go down any path that could lead to addiction.  I'm looking for how other people have actually dealt with long-term serious anxiety and have overcome it.1+ Comments Loading... }}},{{{You have to take the anticipation of something going wrong out of your life.

Every emotion communicates to you a message about how you perceive your situation.  The message of fear is there is a threat and that threat will "kill" you.Fear is experienced as the hair on the back of your neck rising up (piloerection) and, perhaps, a sense of dread.  It is a clear and easily distinguished feeling. It is an innate (not learned) feeling.  It can be the feeling you get when you are in an isolated dimly lit garage and hear noises you do not recognize.  It can also be the feeling you get when you are about to enter an elevator and see someone standing there who looks fine but about whom you have a very strange feeling.  While I talk about both anxiety and fear in my book Emotions as Tools A Self Help Guide to Controlling Your Life not Your Feelings, the best book to read about fear is The Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker.In contrast, anxiety tends to be a future based emotion which is most likely learned.Anxiety alerts us to something that might happen.In other words, we learn what to be anxious about.The message of anxiety is that there MAY be a threat and the threat MAY be harmful to me.People experience anxiety in different ways. I experience anxiety as a churning feeling in the pit of my stomach. You might experience it as racing thoughts or something else.Anxiety is the feeling my students get facing an exam when they aren't prepared.  It may be the feeling you get when your boss sends you an email that he/she wants to see you in their office right after lunch.Fear says..."Escape,NOW".Anxiety, if used as an effective tool, alerts you to a situation you need to assess and if there is a future threat, make a plan to do something about it.If you are anxious about exams, develop a plan to study.If you are anxious about that trip to your boss's office, take your lunch hour and review what you have done that might be an issue.With anxiety, you can choose to ignore the feeling if your assessment tells you there is nothing that represents a threat.You have studied for and are prepared for the exam.You have no idea why the boss wants to see you.  Maybe he/she has an exciting project they want you to head up.In summary, fear and anxiety, as emotions,  are not the same.  If used as tools, they should very different reactions (no thought involved) and should lead to very different responses (thought/planning/execution).There is one exception..When people say, "I am afraid of public speaking."  They imply fear but mean anxiety.  As long as they know the difference and do not demean the emotion of fear, there is no harm in the colloquial (although incorrect) use of the word "afraid".I hope that answers your question.Ed Daube, Ph.D.The Emotions DoctorEmotions as Tools A Self Help Guide to Controlling Your Feelings not Your LifeAvailable on Amazon}}}

Fear can induce anxiety and anxiety can induce fear, so they tend to go hand in hand, but they are not exactly the same. Anxiety is simply the feeling of anticipation. So we can be anxious about happy things like graduating, or getting married, or going on vacation. These things can also be scary for some people, but others wouldn't find them scary at all. I think it is best to think of anxiety as excitement, which can come from good and bad things. People can also be anxious about seemingly unimportant things particularly when having an anxiety disorder. For example, OCD. It's not fear that makes the person anxious, it is the desire to fulfill the compulsion and the anticipation that comes with waiting for the compulsion to be fulfilled. A person with OCD is not afraid of what will happen if their shirts are not arranged in color order. They can acknowledge that nothing bad will happen, but they are anxious because they just can't wait for the shirts to be arranged. Also consider the fact that you can be afraid of something without being anxious about it. For instance, I am afraid of mice. But I only get anxious about seeing one or being near one when I am expecting that to happen. In this case, my fear can cause me to be anxious.}}}

I can't express myself. I have no control over my thoughts and feelings when around people. I think that everyone is monitoring me for a flaw in my appearance or attitude (or just about anything I can think of about myself). Whether it's my clothes, the way I walk; what I'm looking at; my facial expressions. I know logically that the possibility of every person I see looking out for those flaws are ridiculous; but in my mind, I can't help but get the feeling that they are. It causes me a lot of stress and insecurity..School for me is a living nightmare. It's where I experience the most anxiety and emotional pain of my day. It's just a bunch of running away and hiding -- hoping people don't see you and make fun of you. I have this notion that everyone is against me and dislikes me as a human being -- even some of my nicest friends I'm suspicious of. When I'm in school, I map out the quickest routes to my next classes. I had remembered over the first couple of days in school, where children are most scarce and where I can keep myself obscure from them. Any social contact at all with them would cause me to panic and worry uncontrollably. I can't maintain conversation because I have this constant belief that he or she is looking out for anything about me to make fun of once I walk away. When class would end, I would go straight from the room I was in, take the nearest staircase directly downstairs to the first floor (I was on the second), go through that particular hall in which there were no if not slightly any kids at all, to the next staircase, back upstairs, and rush into my class. I did this same routine every day for most of my classes. I can't stand to walk directly to my next class because that would require me to look at other children as I walk by. I'm afraid they might say something about me, or if I look at them the wrong way, shove them as they go by or step on their shoe, I'll get into a confrontation.Even if there is one person walking by I panic just as much, yet trying to look the most casual I possibly can. But from one look at him I'm already convinced that he's being critical of me, so I try to look comfortable and "normal" anyway. I put one hand in my pocket first so that makes me look comfortable, right? But then what about my face? Do I look nervous? Is my mouth open too wide? Do I look angry because of my stress? I decide to look down so he won't see my face. But what if he looks at me and realizes that I'm scared and putting my head down because I don't want him to see me? I then put my head up and look to the direction where he is not. If he's looking left at me, I look right, and vice-versa. But what if I look silly looking in the same direction for all this time? I look straight ahead. But then I panic again and assume the cycle over and over until that person passes from my line of sight. This is why I can't be in big crowds of loud obnoxious teenagers; it would drive me mad.During lunchtime, I'd go outside of the lunchroom and upstairs into the staircase and eat there. I would sit in the back staircase where less kids would come. I couldn't stay in that cafeteria because of all the eyes and noise and the very fact that every person in that room had thoughts that I could not control; thoughts that could be about me. I can only remember a handful of times I stayed inside the cafeteria instead of rushing towards the staircase. While the noise would get louder each time more kids came in, I would get smaller and more and more scared as time went on while I was inside that cafeteria. I counted every minute inside there. Those dreadful 20 minutes of torture. But even inside the staircase I wasn't safe from my anxiety. I would, once again, let my brain get the best of me. I thought, what if the kids come back here, see my poor, lonely self and start to make fun of me. Each time I heard a door open and footsteps I would assume it was a teenager, panic, and try to run away from the footsteps and into to a quieter place.This doesn't just apply to school, though. At home, around my neighborhood, I can swear that the cashiers at my local store laugh and make fun of me every time I leave the store.Stress:Anywhere I go, where there are other people around, I can literally feel their presence. Because I think everyone is judging me, whether I know it or not, the pressure is unbearable. I get hot, sometimes sweaty depending on how loud or close the people are around me, and very fidgety. The only way I can escape this (while staying in the same place), is either eating or obscuring my face from everyone. There are reasons for this: Firstly, eating numbs the pain of social anxiety. Don't get me wrong, the stress and anxiety is still there and I can feel it, it's that eating distracts me from thinking fully about myself or other people, so the stress is cut in half. And secondly, hiding my face from others makes me believe that they don't see me, and if they don't see me, they won't judge me.When two or more people are having a conversation, I immediately get the idea that they are talking about me. What makes it worse is their laughter. Their laughter exacerbates the feeling of their taunting me. My head starts to hurt and I look around a lot to make them think that I don't hear them or that I know that they are talking about me. Sometimes they really are talking about me, so I never really know if they are or are not. This gives me another reason not to trust people, even the nicest of people, because of my anxiety. I've lost a lot of friends because of this, and some people do actually dislike me. But they don't know about my problem and I'm afraid to tell them because my problem prevents me from doing so.When a person does make fun of me, it's a crushing blow to my psyche. I literally feel dizzy, weak, sleepy, and even more depressed. I can barely stand on my own two feet because of how weak I feel. The only benefit to this is that the depression makes me apathetic to the things that would normally cause me anxiety. Most of those feelings digress for about an hour except for the depression (which lasts for most of the day).Insecurity:Because of this anxiety, I shut down all emotions. I look like a miserable slob walking down the street. It's not something I do consciously, it's involuntary and it's caused me a lot of problems the past few years. Since I believe that everyone is looking at me and talking about me, I feel like I'm a showcase, and the physical emotions that I display are all part of the comedic show. I feel like every single movement of my face is a means to laugh at me. Whether it's a modest smile or the ascension of a single eye brow, I feel so recorded. To stop this, I go emotionally neutral. I don't smile or frown or laugh or look confused. I want to seem like a person to give 0 attention to. This is an ironic attempt at zeroing myself out in that everybody thinks I'm mad when I'm not (I've been told that a few times). And because of that I'm a laughing stock. Since going emotionally neutral has become more unconscious than conscious, I'm trying my best to look like a "happy" person now. I try to crack a soft smile now and then, but that only makes me feel more like a freak since I don't really feel that way.I'm a people pleaser. I can't stand to have somebody mad or upset with me even if I'm just palling around with a "friend". If I say something that can be suggestively offensive, it will run through my head for days, maybe even weeks. I question my actions and ask myself whether or not that person's feelings were hurt from what I said. Even if it's completely logical that the person's feelings were not hurt (for example, the person laughs after I say the thing that I thought was offensive), I refuse to think that way. I feel constantly sad and upset and angry at myself unless I talk to him/her again to reassure our friendship ("companionship" since I'm not really that close to anyone). Yet I never get around to talking to that person on my own because of my paranoia and nervousness. This is why I don't talk to people or want friends.Social Awkwardness:Don't be offended if one day I meet you and seem like a nice person, but the next day I meet you and seemingly treat you like dirt. It's part of my anxiety: The first day I meet a person I know logically that their mind has no information about me. They haven't a clue about my personality at all. So I force myself to act natural assuring myself with the fact that they haven't received any information from any of their friends, about how weird, awkward, and shy I am. We might get along well and possibly become best friends for that first day. But the next day I meet you, I will ignore your presence entirely and not speak to you unless you confront me. I'm worried that when I come up to you and speak, I'll only be confirming the lies and rumors you've heard about me since the last time we met, or the speculation you might have about how weird and socially awkward I am (even though on the day you first met me, you might have thought I was a cool and nice person). These are things I conjecture from my anxiety.I also can't look people in the eye. Not only am I self-conscious of my personality, I'm also self-conscious of my face. I'm afraid of people thinking I'm ugly, and, again, if I don't see them, they don't see me. So I look away from them when they're speaking even though I know they can still see my face.All I want in terms of my disorder is isolation and privacy; and for it to stay that way unless I'm feeling too lonely or, in rare cases, a bit "social".}}}

Anxiety (and depression) greatly affect my studies. Many of my classes this year have begun to focus on participation and group work for the marking scheme. Wanting to do well in school, I raise my hand in class. If my hand is up for more than 5 seconds, I start to worry extensively that: i. maybe the professor doesn't like me, ii. maybe it was a stupid time to engage the class, iii. maybe I'm about to say something stupid. I quickly put my hand down and internally panic about this for the next half an hour. I miss the opportunity to take notes in class or focus. I can barely hear anyone at this point. I worry whether or not any of my classmates can see me shaking, pulling on my sleeves, looking down at my desk attempting to avoid eye contact. Then, I say hello to my friend after class. I panic for the next hour about: i. whether or not they find me annoying, ii. if I interrupted them or distracted them from something they were doing, iii. if I said something that was worthless. I leave the lecture hall feeling sweaty, nauseous, jittery and suffocated, knowing that I still have to go to another lecture in a few hours. I try to get a coffee, even though coffee is usually not advised for people with anxiety it's just about the only thing that turns my day around. The coffee place doesn't take debit, I ask if I can run to the ATM. The barista gives me a dirty look, says she'll void my order and take it when I come back. When I walk over to the ATM I'm worried that people are looking at me like I'm an idiot for not being able to pay. I come back with a twenty and wait 8 minutes, staring at the barista, waiting for her to notice me and take my order again. I don't want to yell at her or try to get her attention, I don't want to make any noise. I leave without coffee. I go sit in one of the lounges at school and wonder if I need to rush myself to the university's health and wellness centre for the third time because I have had mental breakdowns every year since I have been at this school, financial and academic issues made much worse by anxiety. But a friend finds me in this lounge. Now I have to try and act normal, try to turn off an anxiety attack at the flip of a switch. I realize that I am going to have to completely shut myself down like this another 5-6 times today just to get through any of my classes, and after the hour long bus ride home in freezing weather, I will curl up into a ball on my bed and just breathe heavily and rock back and forth for a while until I can calm down and get something done. Having anxiety and having anxiety attacks while in the public sphere is a process of constant hiding, shaking, suppressing, and numbing - from friends, strangers, co-workers, classmates, bosses and teachers. Some people may believe that the person with anxiety sees everyone as their enemy, when the case is we usually see ourselves as the enemy.}}}

It got to a point that around high school, I said enough was enough......I had just moved down to Texas from North Carolina and decided this would be a fresh start--a new beginning. No one down there knew me, so I could just be "me" and they would never question the fact that I had changed. Well the year started and lo and behold, I was still the same quiet guy in class. I mean I did speak out a little more and made a few friends, but still the anxiety was there and the constant thoughts continued to bombard me on a daily basis. The bad thing is that around this time I discovered alcohol! I would go down to Mexico, since it was literally minutes away, and drink myself away with "friends" and family. After graduating high school, I moved back to Carolina and continued this trend of drinking on the weekends and even started hitting up clubs and bars. I made so many "friends," that I thought I was actually starting to become a little popular. I would arrive at parties and people would yell my name upon entering, it was pretty sweet. I was less conscious with alcohol (of course) and people liked me. BUT deep down inside, I knew all of his was just a facade since that was just drunk me... not at all real me. There were hints of me there, but a drunk person is definitely not themselves or obviously in any of their normal senses.For once in my life though, I felt so happy to have other people to hang out with. I continued this lifestyle for a couple of years and it led to some very terrible things. Firstly, around this time I was in college and due to the constant hanging out, drinking, and clubbing I started to fail all of my classes and soon enough stopped attending all together. I don't mean to toot my own horn either, but I was pretty smart and applied myself all throughout grade school. My family knew I had a promising future, but because I yearned to finally socialize far more than anything else, I gave up on schooling and kept at it with clubbing. Secondly, I went from drinking on weekends, to drinking every single day! It got to a point that I had to literally drink to put myself to sleep at night. I would wake up and drink because I could not go on throughout my day without it in my system. I wanted to feel the buzz everywhere I was. If I wasn't tipsy, I would experience angst. Yes, this means I was out in public drinking and even driving around tipsy; potentially placing others and myself in danger, but thankfully nothing ever happened. I would pour alcohol in coffee cups, to-go cups, and bottles to hide the fact. I still recall this one time very vividly when I went to a hospital with a friend because his manager had just had a baby. This manager knew me somewhat, so I figured I'd go in and congratulate her as well. I had a few too many coffee cups of alcohol on my way there and the whole thing was incredibly awkward. Somehow I failed at calculating how much to drink before arriving at the hospital. Getting the right "social buzz" required a very specific amount of drinks under a certain amount of time in order to avoid being drunk. Basically I aimed at drinking just enough to feel less anxious, but with alcohol it's not easily calculable. It was bright as day outside, must of been noon, and my friend and his manager just stared at me in disgust. I was so ashamed. When I went home that day, it just got me thinking that what the hell was I doing. I was terribly upset and knew I had to stop this. So I did, I stopped cold-turkey that day and moved back in with my parents. I had dropped out of college and slowly over time these friends I had made, were entirely starting to get out of the picture. All they wanted to do was drink and party, and if I wasn't going to do that then there was nothing we had in common to do together. I couldn't even act myself with them anyways, unless I had a drink. So they weren't truly my friends and I wasn't truly popular. I was someone suffering of social anxiety and I had wrongfully fallen into the trap of alcoholism to "cure" myself. I still haven't seen a psychiatrist, although I do want to and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is suffering of this. Drinking is definitely not the way to go, because it will just ruin your life and you could also end up hurting others besides yourself. Today I just work hard at pushing myself out of my little box and comfort zone. It's the best I can do for now and it does make a difference to just push yourself to speak up and stop the over-thinking. The world is not obviously revolving around me, or you with the social anxiety, and it all boils down to changing your mentality about that. I hope no one ever falls into the steps that I did, and if you or someone you know is facing similar problems PLEASE get some help. It's not a bad thing to seek help, and it will lead to a healthier and happier life. I'm just waiting for my benefits to kick in at work, and I'm off to schedule my first psychiatric/therapy appointment. I'm glad to say that where I am today is actually the best I've ever been in terms of my SAD... but there is still space for further improvement. :)}}}

Do I have some type of ADHD. Well no, not ADHD I'm not hyperactive at all. But maybe I have its little brother ADD. My attention feels so fleeting and my brain often seems to let me down. Why am I having such a hard time focusing at work. I feel so much pressure, but my boss doesn't really put pressure on me. Where does all this stress and distraction come from?Who am I? Am I so distracted because I don't like the job, or am I just not getting enough nutrients or sleeping well. Is there actually anything I do like? I read the papers, because people often talk about the news. It would be embarrassing not being able to talk about events. It feels so embarrassing when someone asks a question or talks about something, having no idea what to answer or say in return.I should keep up with technology, that's what the guys at work so often talk about. I should catch up on history, and geography, everyone seems to know so much about those things, or at least the fundamental facts. I should learn how to comment on movies. Why do I keep forgetting the storyline of movies I've seen while everyone else seems so much more opinionated. When I went to a movie with colleagues I was so afraid about the discussions afterwards, that I missed out on half of the movie. I should read more books. Every educated and intelligent person seems to read books and knows so many things. People would think less of me if I don't read.I should learn how to cook better. If someone comes over I would feel so ashamed if things go wrong with a dish or if they don't like it....People seem to know so much more than me. I feel stupid, despite me knowing I'm not really stupid. How come I'm so good in fooling everyone. I've fooled everyone through high school, and I even managed to fool everyone at university, and now I get away with it at work... How long can I keep this up? How come I get away with this all? The stress that I'm doing something over my head is killing me. What if they find out that I'm not who they think I am? Why do they like me? It feels that being a nice person is the reason I get away with it. I've screwed myself by pretending to be better than I really am. I've been pretending so long that I don't know who I am anymore. What do I really like? Sometimes it feels that I'm interested in everything, but is this true interest? Other times it feels that I'm interested in nothing and then hating myself for not having interests.I browse the web, from disorder to disorder. I have symptoms. It seems I have symptoms of every possible disorder. Everyone has some symptoms. Everyone could go to a psychologist and be diagnosed for something. I am however doing quite well. I am a happy person most of the time, I have a good job, I have a social life... My problems are not psychology material. If you would meet me, you see a 27 year old, athletic, sexy, modest woman :-P, albeit maybe a bit shy in the beginning or silent during some occasions... but I can be outgoing as well and make jokes. What is wrong with my mind? Why is my mind driving me so crazy, when my life is actually good. Why does this happen every single day, and why do I think so badly of me and put so much weight on what other people think of me. Why do I surround myself with people that look so good, that know so much, that are so intelligent and interesting. I would be so ashamed if they think bad of me, even knowing they are not perfect and they probably have their flaws as well.Why when I walk to the coffee machine with a group of colleagues it kills me inside. The silence... what do I say... should I ask about their work... oh god I don't know what they're working on right now. I don't dare to ask, because they'... (more)Loading...}}}

I cannot even fathom sometimes how other people do it -- how do they go through life without the absolutely constant front-of-the-mind thoughts about how someone can look at you and see you speaking. Just the simple thought of someone looking at me, and myself knowing this, makes me incredibly conscious and nearly causes me to stop in my tracks (so essentially more awkwardness). For so many years I could not look anyone in the eye for more than a microsecond -- even my parents or significant other -- as then it becomes more apparent that they are looking at you.It's the constant and intense feeling of severe judgement by others, and the tiny thoughts you think you can see flicker across their faces when they look at you.}}}

Some people have been like this for as long as they remember, and some people, like me, develop it suddenly and it's a constant struggle to find out where it spawned from. You often want to blame yourself, but sometimes it's a mixture of different situations you've been through. Everything becomes increasingly difficult. Holding a job, going to school, forming relationships, and even remaining in relationships and friendships you already thought were stable. I'm 22 years old and I think my SA started being predominant at about the age of 18 or so. Starting college was difficult. I strayed away from the things I thought I'd succeed at because of the fear that I would have to assert myself socially, or do too many things that included public speaking; there just seemed to be way too many opportunities for me to make a fool of myself. I felt like everyone I spoke to was more intelligent, had more to offer, and was judging my intelligence, my personality, and my appearance. This led me to stop going to classes and eventually stop going to school all together.Jobs were the same way. I've only had two. The first job I ever had was in retail at a big chain and it might've been the reason I've gotten so bad. I was a cashier and having to make small talk with people on a consistent basis was terrible. From the beginning to the very end of an 8 hour shift I felt like i had to make a constant EFFORT just to talk to the people that came thorugh my line or my co workers and it wore me out physically and mentally. Sometimes I wouldn't know what to say to people or people would make mention of how quiet I was and I would cry. I ate lunch in the bathroom to avoid my co workers, not because I didn't like them but because I didn't think I'd have anything to say to them. All my friendships started failing because I would avoid going out. My friends thought it had something to do with them, but really i just felt inferior to every human being i came in contact with and before i hung out with even my closest friends i would repeatedly think of all the things that could go wrong and how they wouldnt enjoy being with me.Of course, it was all irrational and i understood that very well and still do. I understand that people don't pay that close attention to the things i do and say and I also am not that terrible to be around. I'm quite fun when I'm not overthinking things and I have a lot to offer in a conversation but once I start thinking about it I become very quiet and weird.It's ruined school and relationships for me and I also won't apply to jobs that have a lot of interaction with people (with is most) so I've ended up without a job and bills to pay. This is what it's like. A constant struggle with yourself that you know is ridiculous but still continues and you cant do anything about it but watch all the things in your life fall apart because of it.}}}

Instead my mind would be racing, thinking about what they are thinking of me, what I could say, what they would think of me if I said it, what they must be thinking of me standing here weirdly saying nothing at all...Then, I'd get home and my mind would start racing again. I would play over again and again the interaction, trying to make sense of it.Honestly what's helped the most is interacting with many different kinds of people and seeing how meaningless and arbitrary people's perceptions are. Seeing other people get insecure is also an eye opener.I still often stay silent and just listen, but I am becoming more comfortable in my quietness. Ironically I think others are a lot more comfortable around me now that I care a lot less about it.}}}

There are different versions of social anxiety disorder. Mine is not  really about socializing but is more like I only have a problem outside,  out of my 'safe place', which is my home. I have no problem with talking to  people or making friends, but I have panic attacks when I'm in crowds,  it's hard for me to hang out at a coffee shop, for a whole month I was  completely agoraphobic and couldn't even go to my neighbor's house. It  was years ago and I got much much better, but I still have social  anxiety disorder. What is it like? It's like you live with a prison. Not  in a prison, but with a prison.I  can afford traveling to Hawaii, but I can't. I still don't feel good  enough to go too far away from house. When I spend more than an hour in  traffic, I have major panic attacks. (At a level that once when I was  taking a bus trip, they had to stop the bus. Which was actually the  beginning of my anxiety disorder.) If I somehow feel tired, I have to  cancel all my errands because my anxiety disorder gets worse. Sometimes  when I'm outside, I start to get dizzy, nauseous, sweating, and feel like  fainting. I can't tell you how many times I went outside to meet up some  friends, and went back to home mid-way because I was feeling attack-y.  How many times I dropped something I wanted to buy because I got nervous  waiting at the check-out line. For me, when I'm by myself, it's a bit  better. Whenever I am with friends or family outside, it gets worse. I  feel like if I want to go back to home, to my safe place,  I won't be able to do that without disappointing them. That makes me  put pressure on myself and that pressure makes the thing I'm scared of  happen -- I leave them right in the middle of the restaurant or during a  bowling game.I  have to confess though. I don't help myself. Getting professional help  is great and sometimes completely necessary of course, but what is even  more important is that you should go after your fears. I was a very shy  kid back in the day, through the first month of elementary school, I  couldn't sleep because I was too nervous, I got diarrhea because I was  too nervous (when you're too nervous, your digestive system works more  than it should). So how could I continue going to school? Because I had  no other choice. There is no 'homeschool' in my country, and I had to go  to school. The first month was extremely difficult, yes, but in the  meantime, I was talking to other kids, I made some moves to talk to  other kids, and I started to make friends. Soon, I HAD friends, and I  got use to that environment and poofff...anxiety disorder was gone. My  mistake now is that I run away from my fears and feed them instead of  facing them like I did when I was a kid. If I socialized more even if I had panic attacks when trying, I would still get use to such social situations and soon that would become a 'normal' thing rather than something that makes me nervous. I'm not doing that but working on it.}}}

Honestly, it is very hard at times. As some other people have said, you feel like you can't express yourself or express your opinions which is very hard for me because I feel like I need to. I do believe that if I didn't suffer from this, I would be an extrovert. I used to be a lot worse in elementary school. In 4th grade, I didn't talk to anyone. In 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 6th I did have a couple of close friends that I knew and I was never really anxious around them, as well as my family. I never hesitated to strike a conversation with my friends and family. I have been taking a medication (paxil, I believe) in about 4th grade and saw a psychiatrist recommended by my mom (of course). Actually not really recommended but a force. I don't think I really knew that I had social anxiety in elementary school for unknown reasons. Anyways, in 9th grade, I made more friends, so there's something positive & I did finally realize I had social anxiety which was a mixture of good and bad. However, I had a couple of friends who were really bad influences on my life. They regularly verbal bullied me and never really seemed to care what I said on any topic. Given the fact that they were both Mexican (not trying to be racist but these too were not good people) and one of them came from Compton, which is basically a ghetto place in California, PLUS I lived in Utah and I was a previous mormon at the time! Imagine that! The one friend that came from Compton especially had an effect on me from calling me dumb and telling me to shut up at various moments; she never really valued anything I said and I thought I was under herself because I was too "goody goody" and she was the exact opposite. Anyways, the next summer I really started to analyze her personality and started to research narcissism and realized that "wow! She really has some narcissistic points in her persona!" I think that was definitely a relief for me given the fact that I had blamed myself for every mistake she pointed out in the past. If you are not aware, narcissists behave in a very "it's all about me" way and have no sympathy towards other people, although it may seem so but that's generally just because they're trying to get their way. Ding, ding, ding! There's the answer for my numerous down days feeling like I was nothing. Oh, and I wasn't taking Paxil during my 9th grade year because my psychiatrist recommended to do that and see how it would go-terrible idea! So onto my 10th grade year I went back on my meds and started to take pills for my suspected ADD, and really things got much better. I joined this big group of friends and enjoyed talking to old friends, and new! Except, the one Mexican friend...that was a little bit of a downer and I definitely did get anxious talking to her after not seeing her all summer and getting in numerous texting fights throughout the summer. But, my opinion did change of her and so did my opinion of myself. So, throughout the next year I did go through some anxiety prone social situation occasionally, but after each one I generally chose to think as positive as possible and change my attitude towards the situation. I did ask my dad to get me a psychologist because I really wanted to get better and improve my self. I can't tell you it's all dandy and good right now in the summer before I start my junoir year but I can tell you that I have gotten better and handling social events better and socializing. So, in conclusion, it really depends on how the person with SAD treats the situation. The earlier the better. I'm glad I'm doing this now because earlier is always better. It really can be so hard and you can feel like your literally the only one going through that situation, but it's up to YOU & your mind to make it better.Thanks for asking!}}}

I keep fearing that my parents will die even though they are only in their 50's and are relatively healthy. As an only child, they are all I've got. I don't have any close friends. If they leave, I will be left alone. That is what scares me. These irrational negative thoughts make me very depressed and bring me to tears. I wonder if this is normal and if parents feel this way about their children all the time...that they could die at any moment. Maybe I just feel lonely even though I am not alone, yet. It's more of a fear that I will be alone someday. I am, however, pretty independent, so I shouldn't be afraid of making it out on my own. No, I think I fear the possibility that I will never see them again before I turn 40.I also have anxiety and an irrational fear that I will accidentally kill someone. Every time I drive, I fear that I will hit a pedestrian or biker because I didn't see him/her. I hate driving.These thoughts, however, are not intruding my life in any way; I am socializing regularly and I have a job. Instead, I value my time with my parents more now because I am so afraid that I will lose them. Still, these thoughts make me anxious and depressed. I cannot seem to think rationally. Is there a way to resolve this on my own? }}},{{{I'm not sure that I can say what is or isn't normal, but I can say that you're not alone. Being an only child myself, I have also worried about where I'll be when my parents are gone. I try to spend time with my parents when I can, knowing that I'll have those memories when they're gone is a comforting thing for me.I think worrying a bit from time to time is better than holding all my worries in and letting them overwhelm my thoughts. I guess the same can be said for your fears while driving. Accidents happen, but as long as you're doing what you're supposed to be doing, the chances of something happening are greatly reduced.My only other advice would be that maybe you should share some of these thoughts with friends and loved ones. This way, you may be able to find comfort and help from those that know you best.}}}

There are many things that will cause this but you have done the most important thing, so far.You have paid attention to your body and how you feel. You have recognized that something is out of the norm.This might be a simple problem caused by a minor deficiency or it could be something major that needs immediate treatment. Most important, for a healthy person who has a sudden onset of general malaise, there is something not right. Do not delay diagnosis from your doctor by trying different immediate stop gap measures. Indeed, your doctor may find that some of the aforementioned solutions are what is needed but it would be highly irresponsible of you to delay diagnosis and treatment while you try a bunch of different recommendations from people who do not know you, likely have never seen you and cannot diagnose you.So please, go to the doctor.}}}

If you took a photo of just the passenger area, you would never know the car was in an accident. But it was completely totaled. It was a terrifying experience that made me screaming and swearing pissed off, especially since the only reason I could get out of the car was because I am so thin since the doors would only open a tiny bit. Since that accident, I have had minor panic attacks whenever I have had to get on the freeway, rush hour or not, even if I'm not driving. I'm saying they are minor because I don't pass out, but they feel horrifying to me, driving me to the point of tears or hyperventilation at times. Sometimes I have no choice but to take the freeway, so I have had to try to overcome this irrational (to me) reaction. It's gotten a little easier over time, it's been about 5 years, but it does take time and an understanding of why I react this way. To me, my panic is irrational. So I practice deep breathing and forcibly relax myself whenever I need to confront the issue. Try to recognize your triggers and work slowly to overcome the issue. If you feel you are overreacting, you can start to work on it. There is no quick fix and it is a big deal to you regardless of what others may think or say. So tiny, tiny steps may help you to eventually overcome. :)}}}

Every time I make it through a rough spot and manage to keep my head, I feel less weak.  Think of each source of stress as a wall that's keeping you from being happy, then break them down.  They do build up and get tougher over time, so it's more like maintenance.  And be realistic with yourself.  You may be dealing with this for a long time, but you will manage, and it will get easier.  I'm one of the worst cases my psychiatrist has ever seen, and he was amazed I had managed on my own so long.  It can be done alone, but don't be afraid to ask for help and understanding.  You deserve that.  Hang in there.}}}

The first is about one's primary sources of happiness, energy, inspiration, contentment. The second is about being ruled by anxiety and fear vs. being empowered, assertive, independent, self-confident.Although our culture is prejudiced against them, introverts can be happy, successful people. The sort of person who derives great pleasure from gardening, painting, writing novels, composing music, conducting research, building things or solving puzzles on his or her own. Not necessarily loners, introverts have relatively few but very deep relationships. Social anxiety is really a severe form of shyness (but not as severe as social phobia). Introverts can be socially anxious and still do well in life, provided they aren't determined to achieve things that are normally awarded to gregarious extroverts (like leadership positions). Social situations may make them uncomfortable, but they'd just as soon avoid those situations anyway, which many regard as a waste of time or a drain on their energy.Extroverts are energized by being around and interacting with other people.  You can practically see them (us) light up when the phone rings, a friend stops by to say hello, or they run into someone they know around town. Belonging to a "tribe," feeling like a member of the club or the gang is important. They quickly become depressed if stuck with a solitary task or project that takes a lot of time with little human interaction.  As an example, looking at common jobs that young people do to make ends meet, the extrovert would rather wait tables or work the cash register at Starbucks than clean houses or do data entry, and the introvert is the other way around.If you're shy but also an introvert, you maximize alone time and enjoy it.  If you're a fearless extrovert, you're the life of the party or the happy-go-lucky sales guy.  The anxiety is a serious damper on an extrovert who wants to be "out there" a lot more and sells him/herself short by being ruled by fear and negative self-talk.  Fortunately there's help if you seek it.  Medication and therapy both can make a difference.}}}

I've grown up very extroverted, I love meeting people and making friends, It's what gives me energy. And although I do cherish my alone time, being an extrovert, it's draining. Unfortunately, when I'm around people, especially unfamiliar ones, I will start to feel incredibly uneasy. Normal thoughts like "that was an awkward thing to say" or "why are they looking at me like that" will turn into many paranoid thoughts, coming in so fast it feels like they're attacking me. I'll start to feel worthless, like no one should talk to me or be near me because I'll just bring down their moods and ruin everything, and when I start to overthink what I'm saying only weird and awkward things will come out, and I'll start having a hard time deciphering how appropriate my comments are. Something very characteristic about how I feel is my very apparent mental blocks. When I face a situation my mind interprets as stressful my mind starts screaming "stop stop stop stop stop", adrenaline will start rushing, and my head will instantly fill with different ways to avoid the stressful situation. It's either that or I won't hear anything, all I have is the awful adrenaline rush, and when that's all I feel my brain sounds like it's full of white noise, like a high pitched beep when the TV is on the wrong channel. Often times if I'm talking to someone and my anxiety triggers in the middle, the entire conversation will blank from my head until they remind me of what we were talking about. It's also very difficult to leave the house, once I'm actually out I realize and know it's not that scary, it's not bad at all. But when I'm there with the world looming in at me it seems like all of the outside is impending doom. Scientifically, I've learned, a lot of this is due to my flight response, reacting at small situations that my mind perceives as more serious than they actually are.So as you can tell, this is a very uncomfortable situation, I crave for social interaction and attention, but when I get it I feel all the pressure of being around people. When I'm alone, I want to be around people, when I'm around people, I want to be alone.Another problem is, without socialization, I'll often feel this uncomfortable 'boredom' energy. My body will often shake when I'm sitting down, either that or I have to be doing something with my hands, pick at my cuticles, play with a piece of paper, rub my fingers together in specific patterns. I have to be sure to be distracting myself by something I can put my entire concentration on, or else everything goes crazy. I have hundreds of ideas running through my head any time I'm not doing something that requires my full attention, so it often appears I'm daydreaming, when actually I'm trying to make sense of the 50 things that popped into my head at the same time.Then of course there are panic attacks. The severity depends on what's happening. My biggest trigger is angry yelling. If I'm in a fight with a friend or family and I get too scared, I'll start crying and it'll be difficult to breathe. Words will sometimes pour out of my mouth and I won't know what I'm saying, usually they're repeats of what I was saying before with some other nonsensical things, but there's nothing in my head except for the feeling in my chest, and the feeling of suffocating, drowning. So later, when I'm in my right mind, I'll realize how much I didn't make sense, and I'll just feel so terrible about the situation I won't want to be around people, but the craving for social interaction never leaves.I was diagnosed with a couple different forms of anxiety, including agoraphobia, about 2 years ago, and there are a couple things I've been doing on top of seeing a therapist to help. I've had many people in my life tell me that "I shouldn't use my anxiety as an excuse", as if I were trying to be lazy or something. For all of those out there who know how I feel, I know it's hard to brush stuff like that off, but they can never know what it's like to have something unless they already have it. Some people will never understand that, or they never try to which frankly is selfish. But there are a lot of people out there who do understand, after surrounding myself with people who do understand me (or try to), things seemed to get a little easier. There are some things that are always going to be harder for you, but just know, you're not alone.}}}

Extroverts get their energy by being around people, so if I'm alone for a while, I start feeling drained. It's less fatigue than it is sluggishness. Anyway, the point is, I need people to be energized. The result of this need is that I have a fear of doing/saying something that will make someone not want to be around me. I can't afford to scare anyone off. This contrasts with my desire to be loud and boisterous when talking to people, because I'm just so dang excited to be around them. So what I end up doing is going to parties and then freaking out about everything I did that might possibly have hurt someone's feelings. I also an reluctant to go out sometimes, because I feel like I'll say/do something stupid and no one will want to hang out with me. It sounds stupid, I know, but it's a very real fear. So, in summary, I end up endlessly worrying over my actions because I can't be without people.}}}

It's like you're trapped. Quoting from Marina & The Diamonds lyrics: 'everyday I feel the same, stuck and I can never change. sucked into a black balloon, spat into an empty room'. PERFECTLY describes how I feel in most social situations. However, there are sometimes where I really am not nervous at all. Especially around my family, I never think about what they think about me and if I did think about it I wouldn't care because I don't have expectations for myself around (maybe due to the fact i've known them for years, idk). with my friends or people I don't know very well, I get a little bit anxious and nervous but when I go, but I always end up having a great time and I don't think they see me as socially anxious. this happens all the time. it's like my mind is thinking something completely different than what my actions show or the words I speak, I seem very carefree and happy to them, I believe. I've been getting better though. It's been SO hard for me for the past 3 years or so maybe due to the fact that I was pretty emotionally abused by a ex friend, who knows, but I definitely had more expectations of myself around other people after I met here in 7th grade since she would always point out my mistakes and tell me to fix them. terrible, terrible, terrible. She never acknowledged my feelings and criticized me constantly, especially after I had playfully made fun of her in a "friend" sort of way. Anways, she's out of my life now. no room for people like her. So, anyways, this summer it's been kind of bad wanting to hang with my acquaintances and people i've met over the past school year but always feeling like i'm bothering and annoying them when I ask them to hang. I get very energy drained being alone, but then once I've been around people for too long, I generally go back to being alone. so not a good feeling. But i'm working on it. Staying positive and deciding to be happy is one of the best choices for anyone with SA. Whether extrovert or introvert with SA, it can work. I find myself so much happier when I don't worry about the little mistakes I made or the things I said. I just feel like I'm on top of the world. So, it's not like it's un treatable. With controlling your happiness and taking the right medication, your on to a great start. thanks for asking! anymore questions about this subject I would love to answer!}}}

It was the most horrifying experience of my life. I was unable to move. I started seeing really pixelated, could not speak, started to convulse and thought I was going to die, that I was "going to be retarded forever" or thought I was in a coma and that's what it was like for everyone who was in a coma. Or I thought I was have a seizure I was shaking so violently.I gripped to a beach ball and thought letting it go would cause me to die. I was trying to call and ambulance because it was so painful mentally. This lasted in a varying capacity for about the next week.I must say, I was really stressed when the initial event occurred, had not eaten all day and was extremely tired. I was convinced the pot was laced, but many other people smoked it so I can rule that out. This event changed my life in so many ways. I felt like I had seen an entire different side of myself and perspective on the world, which is a heavy thing to see something so dark. I also feel more empathy than ever before. It's a double-edged sword.I was finally diagnosed with panic disorder about a year ago. Everything culminating up to that was a major struggle including constant anxiety, a hospital visit, and too many colonopins. Now I do psychotherapy and take a small dose of an SSRI. Lucky for us, anxiety is easily treatable and I'm on the way to leading a much happier life. I suggest you do the same (and never let anyone tell you you're 'just stressed' or 'just a stoner' if your anxiety is really bothering you).Use your experience as a blessing-- despite the hard stuff, it will make you more well-rounded and understanding. Also, skip the sativas and stick to indicas.One more thing.. I do not blame marijuana for my panic disorder. I believe it simply got the ball rolling on the inevitable.}}}

My partner, who does not smoke (neitherdo I anymore, but that's by the by), regularly had anxiety attacks. She describes feelings similar to yours so in answer to the last point in your comment, yes other people do feel like this.I am not qualified to give medical advice but my partner spoke with her GP and through a combination of medication and therapy, she is now on the way to recovery.  This video is meant to 'show' what it feels like to have ananxiety or panic attack and the way my partner describes it, this is quite agood representation. The following symptoms are quite common during anxiety or panicattacks: •   a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly(palpitations)•   sweating•   trembling•   hot flushes•   chills•   shortness of breath•   a choking sensation•   chest pain•   nausea•   dizziness•   feeling faint•   numbness, or pins and needles•   dry mouth•   a need to go to the toilet•   ringing in your ears •   a feeling of dread, or a fear of dying•   a churning stomach•   a tingling sensation in fingers•   shivering•   shakingA recent review of the evidence for a link between cannabis use and anxiety concluded that:  "Frequent cannabis users consistently have a high prevalence ofanxiety disorders and patients with anxiety disorders have relatively highrates of cannabis use. However, it is unclear if cannabis use increases therisk of developing long-lasting anxiety disorders.Many hypotheses have beenproposed in an attempt to explain these relationships, includingneurobiological, environmental and social influences". So this study did find a clear link although some of theexplanatory mechanisms remain unclear. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, anxiety and panic can be caused by genetic factors, your own circumstances (particularly if you develop Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), drug use (such as LSD or ecstasy although for some people, the caffeine in coffee is enough to trigger anxiety or panic attacks) and bad or traumatic life experiences.}}}

I had a dormant prolapsed mitral valve which was somehow triggered by the drug. This caused my pulse to speed up to 180 bpm (in a sedentary position). I don't know if it was the fast pulse that triggered the panic, or the panic that triggered the fast pulse, but I've never felt so awful in my entire life. My blood was pumping so fast that all my limbs started tingling, I was clammy, dizzy, short of breath, shaking, and had an intense sense of dread or impending doom. I had smoked a few times before and had never had anything like this happen. The worst part was that the panic attacks did not go away for years after, although they lessened with time and were never as severe as that initial attack.Years later, I had the stupidity to try smoking again, thinking "maybe something was wrong with that one batch" and the same thing happened all over again, fast pulse, shaking, panic. Lasted about eight hours - sheer torture. So while you may not have a heart condition like I did (and found out the hard way) I believe pot can definitely trigger bad experiences and panic in those that are sensitive to it.

Some people appreciate attention no matter the cause, and perhaps this fuels some sort of inherent drive in you. This may be especially true if your anxiety is caused by a perceived lack of self-importance. The panic attacks would make you feel important because people would appear to care.If that is not the case and you do miss the actual physical feeling, Liz Mullen is most likely correct. You probably miss the adrenaline and intense rush of feelings that come along with it. I will admit the feeling of a panic attack is one of the most intense things I've experienced, I suppose I could see how with a different mindset it might be addictive.}}}

(GAD being generalized anxiety disorder.)I believe (but am not a medical professional, simply someone who has panic attacks and anxiety disorder), that the more one has a certain neurochemical response, the easier it is to have that response in the future: Sort of like walking through a forest, it's easier to walk along the tramped-down trail versus breaking new ground entirely. However, the brain is also very resilient- I keep running across the term "neuroplasticity" to describe how the brain can be rerouted and rewired to change feedback and behavior, so that the ways it responds can be changed.Also there are measurable physiologic effects of a panic attack- increased heart rate, respiratory rate, sweating, etc., which are connected to the fight-or-flight response which is connected to the nervous system.

Cognitive behavioral therapy with a combination of SSRI's is the best long term solution. You can actually train your brain to mitigate some of the symptoms and there is a very high success rate of treatment. Please get treated immediately. In its worst case, agoraphobia can develop based on associations with outside triggers that may have nothing to do with the actual onset of panic. Anticipatory anxiety can also develop causing people to live in perpetual fear of panic which to some can be worse than panic Itself. avoid alcohol, caffeine and get exercise daily. Millions of people suffer from panic including highly successful people of all socioeconomic levels. It's not your fault. You can get help.

How do you get rid of them? }}},{{{Panic attacks are the physiological effect of and increase in circulating adrenaline (epinephrine) and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. They are overwhelming because they are a vicious circle. Fear is a useful response to danger. If you are in danger, being afraid makes you more likely to survive and therefore reproduce. Adrenaline is one of the hormonal responses to fear and one of its roles is to prepare you for intense physical exertion. It increases your pulse rate and the force with which your heart contracts. It diverts blood away from your gut and towards your muscles. If your gut is full it will encourage immediate emptying. It opens your airways and increases the depth and rate of respiration and it opens your pupils to let light into your eyes. So when we were in caves this would happen and we would run away from the predator. Intense physical exertion would generate CO2 in the muscles and use up oxygen and all would be balanced. These days we have few predators. So when we get frightened, there usually isn't any activity that will make it better - who can run away from an overdraft? But our bodies react in the same way. We blow out CO2 without replacing it - this lowers the acidity of our blood and irritates nerve endings, giving us pins and needles. We feel the palpitations and the breathlessness and, as we're not exercising, realise that can't be right - we must be really sick. This is a frightening thought, so more adrenaline is released, and the vicious circle has begun. How to stop it then? Two answers: the short term and the long term. Aborting a panic attack that has already started requires time (they never go on for ever) and reassurance. A paper bag helps too as if you breathe back in the CO2 that you have breathed out, the acidity of your blood doesn't change and you feel better. Once it has gone be positive with yourself about how you stood it out and beat it. In the long term there are two approaches, depending on your resources and the triggers. The most successful overall is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, but this requires investment of time and money and a willingness to view the factors that led you to be who you are (that is your self and those around you as you grew up) as potentially harmful. This is not emotionally easy. If there is a recognised trigger (fear of spiders, fear of leaving the house, fear of school etc) then it is just as effective and less resource intensive to do pure behavioural therapy - that is controlled and supported exposure to the thing that triggers the attacks. If this is controlled to the extent that you feel the panic but (vitally) don't run away, the panic will pass and you will relearn at a subconscious level that the trigger is not as threatening as your subconscious had first perceived it.}}}

How someone gets panic is a deeper question.  In an effort to answer in as few sentences as possible, panic attacks are just our reaction to a perception of immediate danger.  It's wired into our DNA and is something that's meant to help us survive in the event we were in *real* danger.  Sometimes people develop a fear of their panic attacks and that fear turns into a phobia of the attacks themselves.  This is where panic gets to be a bit difficult to manage as the panic itself is the thing that the person perceives to be dangerous (even though it isn't) and it turns into a loop of panic.}}}

Meta-analyses consistently show that CBT treatments involving some combination of exposure, applied relaxation, social skills training, and cognitive restructuring techniques are efficacious for social phobia. Across meta-analyses, CBT for social phobia shows moderate to large effect sizes at post-treatment in comparison to wait-list controls (Rodebaugh et al., 2004). It also shows moderate to large within-group effect sizes from pre- to post-treatment. Treatment gains appear to hold or modestly improve at follow-up assessment (Feske & Chambless, 1995; Chambless & Hope, 1996).

Then he recommended I should try group CBT sessions, which I attended diligently for 10 weeks. The changes were slow but steady, and looking back a few years on, I now really appreciate the effects of these therapies.I am really passionate about this subject, so much so I have started a website to help others who are suffering like I did. CBT can be a real life saver, even though for socially anxious people the biggest step to take is to acknowledge the problem, and face our fears head on.}}}

Which, or what, was the trigger??- You get the strong urge to be somewhere alone... to get away from others and be somewhere else to compose yourself.- A strange fog-like state sets in.... things look and sound different... which heightens your sensitivity to everything around you and makes it almost impossible to not just run away... from anyone, anything, in any given scenario. Maybe your driving in traffic when this happens? Doesn't matter... the situation will have you desperate enough to pull over onto what little shoulder there may be on a bridge, desperate to exit the car to get fresh air and escape your current environment, Strange, odd, erratic behavior becomes a common thing in your life. It can't be hidden from those around you who see you in a regular basis. It will hit you while they are near you, at some point. The question is, can you mask it well enough? (This concern/fear becomes yet another stressor.)This isn't necessarily where it ends. This could be just the start, when all the above turns into something worse... a panic attack... a genuine fear of dying right then, right there. At that moment, there's not much you won't do to escape that feeling of impending doom.- Maybe you'll drop to the ground and do push-ups in front of a co-worker if need be, or drop all your groceries in the middle of the shopping aisle and run out the door. You'll do whatever it takes to "escape" it. You develop "survival" techniques.- Mine was waking in circles at a brisk pace while slamming down 2 beers when they hit me in the middle of the night while sleeping. - I also developed a patterned response of doing push-ups. I believed push-ups would force my heart rate to settle into a controlled tempo... so I wouldn't die.These things can destroy you. They completely control you and change you from the person you thought your were. - Did you have plans to achieve great success in life?- Were you a high achiever, attaining professional goals ahead of your peers, and on target for a solid future?- Did you think of yourself as a "strong" person, who didn't need help from others?- Did you look at people who struggled and think to yourself "I'm in the group of people who are different from them", and/or "they just need to buckle down and get their shit together"? I did.But, anxiety and/or panic attacks come from within... it controls you, and eats you up from the inside out. It's you verse yourself. - Maybe you put off getting help like I did for 2 years... all the while watching the things you achieved, and made you feel proud, disappear.- Maybe you put off getting help because you aren't comfortable with needing help? - Or, maybe you have become so overwhelmed by what's happening you have a very hard time leaving your house... and entering a doctors office is about the last place you'd voluntarily go. (Afraid of discussing/hearing what's wrong with you: what it means, will require to tackle it, having to acknowledge you can't fix yourself, etc.)I remember what I was thinking when I finally saw a doctor. I just wanted to feel normal again. To live a normal, functioning life. The professional goals I'd had for years, and all the things I'd envisioned aquiring via professional achievement were of zero importance by that time. I just wanted to sleep, eat, drink, and communicate with others like a normal person. Those had become my needs, my goals.It's been 12 years since anxiety and panic attacks hit me like a brick wall to the face. Things have gotten better. But, the person I was prior will never return... for better and for worse.I still struggle with things that I took for granted... things most people might not give much thought to. But, I live life with a measure of control and with enough "normalcy" to tackle challenges, feel productive, and sometimes, a measure of pride. Last thing... I've read a number of Quora posts regarding anxiety (depression, and other disorders) over the past couple of years, championing an anti-medicinal approach/solution. While I am all for whatever non-medicinal techniques there are that can help individuals contend with issues, I can say without doubt that had I not been prescribed medicine, I would not have turned the corner towards getting better. Prescription medications frequently get a bad wrap... either via anti-big pharma perspectives, or via reference to medicine being given to everyone for anything "these days". I get it... I understand why such criticisms are stated, and references made.But, when everything around you is falling apart, because you are falling apart, big pharma profit margins mean nothing, as does statistical data regarding the increased numbers of those prescribed medicine. Such concerns/discussions/debates are academic. and, for those who aren't personally afflicted and need help... any help... immediately.What matters is the need to get some measure of one's life back. To function at least enough to earn a paycheck. To have the ability to be a functioning member of one's family. For these reasons, prescription medicine can feel like, and to an extent be, a life-saver.(This is the first time I've shared my personal history/struggle with anxiety and panic attacks. I've wanted to a number of times, but always decided against doing so. It's weird seeing these words on the screen for public consumption.)}}}

Nothing has changed. The usual stressors are there, but they aren't anymore intimidating or overwhelming than they ever were before. You wake up, get ready for work, get in the car, and begin your commute. As you are driving you begin to notice that your chest has begun to feel tight, you force yourself to exhale fully and inhale slowly. As you pull into the parking lot you feel a slight buzz running through your body. Your hands are trembling a little bit as you reach for the door handle. You see your coworkers and supervisors and it feels as if a sea of eyes are watching you and judging your every move. You smile nervously and murmur "good morning" as you walk to your desk. Every question someone asks you feels accusatory. Any time someone catches you doing something that isn't strictly work related - glancing at your personal email, stopping for a moment to check your bank balance before going to lunch, perhaps just staring blankly at the screen trying to pull your focus back to where it should be - a spike of anxiety goes jangling through your nerves. You try again taking deep breaths but that slight buzz has escalated to a full on vibration of nervous energy. Your whole body is humming, your teeth are grinding, your fingers are cold because without meaning to you've begun to hyperventilate and your circulation has dropped. By the time lunch rolls around you no longer feel like eating. Your stomach is in knots, you're queasy, and you can't possibly sit still for a moment longer. Instead of eating you consider going for a walk to calm your nerves. The exercise helps to dissipate some of the anxiety but as you come around the final corner of your circuit and the office looms ahead of you again, that same cold feeling begins at the very tips of your fingers. You walk a little faster because coming back even one minute late from lunch will bring on another wave of stares and judgement. The dread comes back again. Your mind begins to race. You wonder if today is the day that they all realize that you're a sham and if today is the day you'll get kicked to the curb. And what will happen if you lose your job? The state's unemployment agency is still struggling so getting unemployment pay is slim to none. It took you nearly a year to get this job. How terrible will it look when you get canned after less than a year? You should just give up and live on the streets. That's where you belong anyway. Just look at you. You're a complete failure. You can't pay your bills on time. You owe money to at least half a dozen people. You're 30 years old and you're nowhere near where you imagined you would be 10 years ago. Remember the guy you were dating back then? 6 years and he never proposed. Why do you think he never proposed? Because you weren't good enough. You weren't good enough then and you aren't good enough now. And you know that by thinking like this you're just making things worse. It's irrational, unrelated, and overly generalized. You know better but your can't stop yourself, which makes you feel worse. Sooner or later the anxiety fades, normalcy returns, and you realize that everything you experienced was manufactured by your own traitorous brain. It seems silly and trivial. But in the moment, it's like standing on trial with yourself as the judge, jury, and prosecutor.}}}

YOu are gonna have to go try new things and trust me, those books wont teach you anything unless you just get out of your house and try new things. THEN maybe the books will make sense (after some application!) I understand for our knowledge you went in detail about all the things wrong with you, but i would love to see the list of things right with you. I am going to dissect your question now: I have issues communicating and am constantly self- conscious.Start with something very small in your life right now (something harmless) and speak up on it. "communication" is an intimidating subject, but if you break it down into bite sizes, it is managable. so start with small things, something safe. I dont know what environment you are in but for example, saying hello to a grocery store attendant. Most likely they are too busy to hold a full convo, so they will just be polite. Great practice for you. maybe saying good morning to a nice coworker (or whatever applies to you) or when you make a meaningless call to telemarketers/cable tv/bank etc, just communicating yourself to the best of your ability (write down beforehand what you want to say on the phone). The point of starting small is you will get a hang of it and INTERNALLY believe that it isnt that difficult. Notice not once did i use the scary words like 'confidence' 'self esteem'. I  shake uncontrollably and avoid most things which lead to embarrassment.  I am totally embarrassed of how my body looks like and feel incredibly  ugly and stupid. My social skills are undeveloped and I am slow minded  so I can't defend myself verbally if I need to. Funny thing: YOU ARE TOTALLY COMFORTABLE expressing yourself by writing on the internet. this is good news. you are not awkward, ugly (we cant even see you yay!), or stupid when you are on the internet! and we cant see you shake so now we cant see how ugly your body is! (i highly doubt its ugly, i am sure you like to exaggerate the details ;)...). Look, you sound very analytical (trust me, i can relate), and you are just naming all the things you hate about yourself. But maybe you have to open your eyes and see there are many awkward people who are embracing their 'awkwardness' rather than shutting it down. Your writing style is funny and honest. Resources:*go on youtube and watch MISADVENTURES OF AWKWARD BLACK GIRL*. this girl is making a Show for HBO now all because she embraced who she was rather than get rid of it. She was an outcast, and then her series from youtube got picked up because it was 'original'. She said kids in Compton said she talked 'too white' and she went to stanford, she always stood out. I hope you get my drift, being different isnt bad....just stop reading damn Cosmo advice columns or watching reality tv (now those women are the one who need real help)* Check out BRENE BROWN ted talk on vulnerability.*}}}

Can it be that you just cannot see for now any real challenge in front of you?Would the term "existential vacuum" describe your feeling better?If there is a chance that this is correct, then I would recommend this book: Man's Search for Meaning. You can see the pdf version here: Page on Spiritual-minds, but it is not nicely printed, so maybe hard copy would be better.I promise you, it is not just another book...}}}

Try working on some projects that are personally meaningful to you; if you like singing, record a song; if you like painting; make a painting; etc. If you pick a topic you are highly interested in, I think you'll find that you become so engrossed in producing high quality work, that that becomes rewarding in and of itself, aside from any financial remuneration you might receive. Focus on being productive, rather than prosperous, and the latter will take care of itself (I believe!) That being said, ensure that you have enough to cover basic material considerations, while you work on your personal projects. Best wishes and good luck!}}}

Nothing, not even doing a spell in a Thai prison, was as frightening as the night terrors. They occurred about once a week, and resulted from hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations. Hypnagogia and hypnopompia are states of consciousness on the edge of sleep and waking. Hypnagogic Hallucinations | Doctor | Patient.co.ukI'd be in bed and at first realize my sense of touch was distorted by rubbing the cotton bed sheet between thumb and forefinger. My fingers would feel swollen like fat sausages and the sheet would hardly exist between them, thinner than rice paper. Next, typically the room would expand and I'd feel like a tiny spec inside it. Then my fingers would shrink down to thin spindles and the sheet became puffy like a pancake. Panic would set immediately and things got really scary - I'd leap out of bed because it felt like I could die if I stayed there. Moving around the room I'd experience synesthesia, a crossing over of my visual, auditory and olfactory senses, I'd see smells for example, hear colours and shapes.Usually by this stage I'd run to get out of any building I was in, which didn't help but remaining within 4 walls was unbearable. My subjective reality just peeled away, outdoors, often in just my underwear, I'd start yelling and screaming because the hallucination got so intense. Things like origami paper insects would swirl around me and sink into my skin, I'd see bubbling pools or lakes of water where there were none. I'd see things that I was hearing, so a whistle in the wind could appear as a creature dashing in my path. The sky became the land, the land became the sky and I'd sometimes start to feel like dead raw flesh, dragging myself through this wide awake nightmare.Sometimes I'd run into the woods or down country lanes in the early hours of the morning because the faster I moved the less trapped I'd feel. But I'd end up several kilometers from home at, say 2am, undressed and hallucinating in terror. I'd sometimes pass out and wake when the sun came up, there could be people walking by on their way to work. Once I woke up by the side of a main road on a pile of discarded, rough cement, I was all cut up and bruised - I thought it was a glowing white water pool during the night and fell back into/onto it.Quite a few people report wonderful experiences during Hynagogia/pompia, but mine were constantly dark, distorted and utterly terrifying. These waking hallucinatory night states are well researched and have an extensive recorded history, but I didn't know what was happening as I grew up experiencing them.Perhaps the most frightening thing about them was that each time I never knew if I'd make it back to reality, even though they happened thousands of times - each experience felt like it could sweep me away not to return to the world.}}}

The best way to enable the healing and to cooperate with it is simply to acknowledge the hurt, and then allow the healing to take place. If this proves impossible after several months, then you might seek the help of an experienced person such as a therapist or older friend.Some people suggest writing a long heartfelt letter.  Express all of your feelings the good and the bad.  Get it all out.  Out of your brain and onto paper.  Then put the letter away.  Months down the road when you read it again, you will see how far you have come.Eventually your mind will be at peace once again.Until that happens reading a good book about your situation may be very helpful for you:Getting Past Your Breakup: How to Turn a Devastating Loss into the Best Thing That Ever Happened to You}}}

If it's been over three months, you probably need to find a neutral party to talk to, preferably a professional counselor. It is normal to grieve a relationship that has ended or changed radically, but if it interferes with your ability to care for yourself, you must actively seek help.  The depth of your depression reflects the extent of how you gave yourself away to the other person. When they leave and take all that away, it's difficult to put yourself back together. But you must, or no one will find what is lovable about you again. I don't really believe in the word "never" because we really don't know what's going to happen in the next second, and impossible things are happening every day. I'm just trying to prod you into action. So focus on the fact that you don't know what the future is going to bring but you do know that you can improve who you are and make yourself someone whom your soul mate would want.}}}

(You might be more willing to open up and share with a younger female Dr. etc...)Remember, it doesn't happen overnight.  When I was 16 I saw a therapist for about a year before I felt that I could make it on my own.  I learned what was really going on inside of my head and why I was doing the things that were making me unhappy.  Good luck!}}}

They want to know about the things that may be bothering you, how your relationships are going with everyone in your life. I understand how you feel, I had to go to a few of them growing up. I had to go to one in my teens and I was underweight at that time. My reason for not eating much was heartache over a breakup, food was the one thing that I could control, but I also just wasn't hungry, I was very depressed.

Don't forget that you can ask them questions too. What got me eating normal again?

Personally I don't want to tell her or him anything but what she or he will already know about by the time we meet (I'm guessing because of what my doctor knows) is:StressPanic attacksMajor weight loss (around 13 kg in a short period of time)Lost period(Doctor: Do you sometimes feel depressed?Me: sometimes.)Depressed (?)What do they expect me to say? Because I'd rather not say anything at all.I'm just anxious, help?<<Update: thank you all so much! It's amazing how many people commented and how thorough you all are! It makes me so happy :)>> }}},{{{There are good therapists and there are not-so-good therapists.There are therapists you 'click' with and those you don't.Some have a treatment style that involves asking you a lot of questions, some have a style that involves sitting quietly until you say whatever comes out.They're just all so different. If you don't click with this therapist, you don't like their treatment style, or whatever, go see someone else. It's worth it, because a good therapist is an enormous help! And a bad one is just a waste of your time and energy.So that said, I would say that when you are seeing a good therapist that you click with, the main thing you will do during a session is basically problem solving. You will come in and say, "I am feeling craptastic today because XYZ is bothering me." Then they will ask a little bit more about XYZ so you can explore all the ways it is bugging you and impacting your life. Then they will help you come up with healthy ways to manage XYZ. You will leave feeling more in control of your own life and with an arsenal of tools that help you deal with the problems you're dealing with.It's my unsolicited unofficial opinion that basically everybody alive should be in therapy. It can really help.}}}

I use medical marijuana to treat my anxiety and panic disorder but I have to stick to indicas or indica-dominant hybrids. I know almost right away if I've just smoked a pure sativa and it often will trigger anxiety and panic attacks. I also have to be careful how much I smoke. If I overdo it I can feel anxious as well. For this reason I also avoid eating medibles as I find it's very difficult to regulate the dosage and is often overwhelming. I've been using medical marijuana to treat my anxiety for over a decade now and feel it's a much better solution than the prescription drugs I've tried. However, it's not without it's side effects and finding strains that work well for you is important. Every strain is different and will affect you differently.}}}

I am not certain about how pharmacologists work in India, but suspect they recommend medications if you describe your symptoms. A psychiatrist is qualified to make a diagnosis, which is what you need before beginning any medication. A psychiatrist in the United States typically makes a diagnosis and, if needed, writes prescriptions for the appropriate medications. Usually, in the case of anxiety, depression, self-esteem issues and assertiveness issues, some type of psychological "talk" therapy is very useful to find new ways to frame your ways of thinking. Self esteem issues are often the result of seeing things through the prism of the past, and cognitive therapy can be very helpful in learning new ways to think clearly and objectively. Psychiatrists often recommend a psychologist for continued therapy after medication is provided. In short, I would see a psychiatrist. I would probably call the largest hospital in your area and ask for a recommendation, or call the local medical association. In the United States, the local medical association does not recommend certain psychiatrists, but instead will give you a list of local practitioners. If you have a general practitioner, he or she can give you a recommendation.Good luck.}}}

It certainly does not have a commonly agreed upon operational definition.Panic attack, on the other hand, is a commonly used term and describes something very specific.

Symptoms develop abruptly and peak within 10 minutes.Increased heart rateSweatingShakingShortness of breath Feeling of chokingChest pain/discomfortNausea or abdominal distressDizziness, lightheadedness, or faintnessDerealization or depersonalizationFear of losing control or going crazyFear of dyingParesthesias Chills or hot flushesThere are 3 different types of panic attacks:Unexpected (uncued) panic attacks are defined as those for which the individual does not associate onset with an internal or external situational trigger (i.e., the attack is perceived as occurring spontaneously "out of the blue"). Situationally bound (cued) panic attacks are defined as those that almost invariably occur immediately on exposure to, or in anticipation of, the situational cue or trigger (e.g., a person with social phobia having a panic attack upon entering into or thinking about a public speaking engagement). Situationally predisposed attacks are similar to situationally bound panic attacks but are not invariably associated with the cue and do not necessarily occur immediately after the exposure (e.g., attacks are more likely to occur while driving but there are times when the individual drives and does not have a panic attack or times when the panic attack occurs after driving for half hour).Source:[1] DSM-IV-TR}}}

That will mask the symptoms without fixing the underlying problem. It will become a crutch. You need behavioral therapy, either self-help or professional. I think self-help works better, but I'm not an expert. In my unschooled opinion, you have a mental conflict between rational thinking and the flight part of fight or flight. The fear is causing stress by dosing you with cortisol and epinephrine. When you get older, you will have health problems and lower life expectancy. Fear cannot move your hand or mouth without permission from your rational brain. It is powerless if you ignore it.  You can teach yourself to ignore feelings that are sabotaging your life. The simplest way is by changing the subject. It doesn't require courage or will power, just think of something else.}}}

Instead practice meditation, I had exactly similar problems after my breakup, it still happens to me sometimes, but meditation is extremely helpful in such cases(at least in my case).Start by closing your eyes, taking as deep breath as possible hold for a few seconds and then breathe out. Repeat this a couple of more times, and as you do this, while breathing in think all happy things, when breathing out think of all negativity moving out with your breath. After this just keep your eyes shut, and try to focus on one thought, it ca be your mother, god, or a point on your wall, whatever you feel comfortable. But your main objective should be the ability to keep your mind blank, no thoughts at all.But this needs practicing, therefore initially just try to focus on one thought, it won`t be easy at first but gradually you`ll get it. But you`ll have to be patient, it won`t affect you immediately like those medicines  but the effect will be ever lasting, without any side effects. Do this regularly twice a day in morning and evening, you should be able to feel the difference within two weeks or less.Search for more such techniques, it can be very helpful.Legal Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, and i have no significant knowledge in the medical field either.

Believe me, you will come out of this.There are many possible reasons why you are going through your panic/anxiety attacks. However, the best persons to determine the reasons with you would be a psychiatrist/ psychologist and a counsellor. A doctor who is a general practitioner will more often than not, diagnose you as having a physical ailment, and hence, prescribe medication accordingly.However, from what you have described and from what I know and have experienced, what you are going through may likely be NOT due to any physical ailment. Hence, my suggestion that you seek treatment with either a psychologist/psychiatrist and a counsellor. They would be the most likely people who can help you sort through the possible myriad of reasons for your attacks.The thing that you have to bear in mind is that the reason things look as hopeless as it does now to you is because of what you are experiencing internally. However, once you get the right help, you will be fine.Your parents may seem unsupportive. This is because they do not understand either what is happening to you.You will have people telling you that medication is not a avenue to take. However, that really is dependent on what you discover with the suggested support people. Medication, counselling, exercise, even meditation are all possible avenues for you to take but first seek the right help.}}}

After a couple of weeks, I wanted to tell the doctor. I saw her and came straight out with it: I'm having a nervous breakdown. I don't know why I said it that plainly - perhaps I wanted to hear myself say those words.That was 10 months ago, and since then I have been on a long-term course of anti-depressants and counselling. The concrete block went quite quickly, but the underlying symptoms are much more difficult to shift: a feeling of helplessness, that my life has stopped, that I am (and I used this phrase in the first counselling session) a piece of s**t on the sole of humanity. I still feel that a lot, a feeling compounded by suicidal thoughts that can sometimes be sustained and extreme. Before the counselling, I had all of that planned out. The suicidal thoughts are now less frequent, but they still come back, albeit less frequently.One of the more material effects was that because I felt helpless and alone, I then shut out all social contact - I have no friends, although years ago the situation was very different. That has created a vicious circle, as I really want to tell someone about all of this, but have no-one to tell. I have only recently found that one of the more popular symptoms of a nervous breakdown is the desire for isolation.What the breakdown has allowed me to do, is to reflect upon my behaviour in the past, and I've since considered that I have probably had 3 other nervous breakdowns in the past (with increasing levels of their effects), but never addressed them as such. That has, at least, allowed me to think of how I can break some of the patterns of behaviour, something I'm currently discussing with my counsellor. I'm still nervous, scared, cannot handle stress, and have a quick temper... but looking back has at least allowed me to look forward in a different light.If you're going through any of this, I'd recommend three things (1) address it as a nervous breakdown as early on as possible; (2) keep your friends and family close and be as honest as you can with them; (3) call or see someone that can help. Even if you don't think that they can, it will feel better that you have told someone that can objectively deal with your situation: a doctor, counsellor, whoever. Sharing will help.Finally, when in more difficult moments, I try to remember Churchill's famous saying, which has really worked for me: if you're going through hell, keep going.(Disclaimer: above is my personal experience)}}}

Usually, when I'm tired I'm more likely to enter a depressive state. Sometimes it vanishes the next day because I rested well. Sometimes, it can last a week. (hopefully no longer). Another element is when the environment changes a lot (I changed country 2 times). Changing too many things at once (friends, habits, work...) threaten the stability ones have and in my case can lead to depression.What does it feel ?Essentially a very strong desire to be alone. I make special efforts to avoid being with other people, and stay silent as much as possible. But the main and most painful sensation is a pure hatred for myself. This lead to a lot of suicidal thoughts. Although I never crossed this line (obviously), I always make very precise plan on how to end my life asap when I'm really depressed. The last effect is a negative bias towards everything (I'm a trash, whatever I did means nothing, no one care nor will ever care and so on). On the physiological plan, I eat less and skip meal sometimes, and I happen to burst into tears with no apparent reason.How did it resolve ?It did not. I am not continuously depressed but it comes back from time to time. What I do is merely try to avoid entering in this depressive state. Because of what I said above, it's hard to exit the depression once I'm there. What help is forcing myself not to think (do some activities, sports or whatever), and forcing myself to hang with some close friends, even if I'm not very talkative at these times, it's better than being alone.Medicine can help too, but not so useful for short-term and recurring depression like mine.Hope you won't experience that yourself.}}}

I was going through this myself, and it was actually quite comforting to read in Founders at Work (http://www.amazon.com/Founders-W...) that even many super-successful entrepreneurs went through the same thing.Anxiety and sleep disorders are certainly quite common. I don't think true bipolar disorder can be be onset from external events, but it's very easy to feel bipolar given the constant ups and downs. I'm sure many entrepreneurs have gone through periods of depression either during long sustained periods of near failure (e.g. trying to keep a failing company alive for 5 years), or after experiencing failure, especially when that failure disrupts your family life and the lives of the co-founders, partners, and employees you have come to care about.I think that self-care, and particularly emotional self-care, is extremely important issues for entrepreneurs and is not given enough attention. Here's the advice that I would offer to help manage it:Eat well and exercise. I know it sounds so basic and mundane, but it is very important. Mike Cassidy (who has had four successful startups including a $500m exit) goes on a run during his lunch break every day, no matter how busy he is.See a therapist. Professional care from a therapist and/or psychiatrist can be extremely helpful. Don't worry that seeing a professional suddenly labels you as crazy. More likely, it will help you from becoming crazy.Be a part of at least one "club" that is completely unrelated to work. I've heard studies that say that having some sort of group you meet with once a week (rec sports team, book club, whatever) increase the average person's happiness literally as much as an extra $80k in income.Don't drink 5 cups of coffee a day. This is the easiest way to ensure you'll have anxiety issues, sleep disorders, and mood issues.Focus on the long term.}}}

With all the hackernews's, techcrunches and mashables out there, it's easy to forget about the product and focus only on the statistically unlikely reward. For me it has to be about the product, the knowledge that I'm building something good - regardless of whether it actually makes me rich. As soon as I start looking ahead, or start thinking that I should have made more progress by now, it triggers a downward spiral of depression.For this reason I can never identify as an entrepreneur, maybe at some point this label will be assigned to me, but I will never use it to describe myself. For me the term has become too tightly entwined with the idea of a big pay-off, and this is the road to depression in my mind.}}}

Here's an account of a random one I had not long ago:Imagine sitting at a cafe having lunch. You leave that cafe to head home, but feel weirdly out of breath, even a bit dizzy. You get home and have a seat and try to catch your breath, but instead notice that your feet and legs are tingling and then the tingling turns to numbness. There's a burst of adreneline. Then you panic. Why is this happening? You become more aware of your heartbeat and the speed and the feeling and the skipped or missed beats. The beating feels so hard and its like your heart is trying to escape from your chest. The trembling starts. Your chest tightens and tightens. You cry. You get really warm. You feel like you're not getting enough oxygen so you place your hand in front of your nose to make sure you're actually breathing and you are, and you're confused. You try to breath deeper and harder and you end up starting to hyperventilate. Then you worry. You cry more. You're not sure why you're worried but you are and you can't help it. Sometimes you worry about dying. You start thinking about all of the things that you're afraid of, like death. Your fears are sometimes irrational but they're fears all the same. You worry about life and things that stress you out. You worry about those irrational fears. It worsens. You work to calm your breathing and try to clear your mind. Minutes and seconds pass — sometimes it's 5 minutes and sometimes it's 15. Once you're able to get a grip, you're exhausted. You're hazy. You feel like you could sleep for a year. Normally afterwards I just end up sleeping. Depending on the situation and my mood, I can sometimes be OK once I wake up but there have been times where I've felt a little off for a few days after.The difference between random attacks and triggered attacks are that the ones with triggers are usually easier to deal with. What I mean by that is I can usually figure out why I'm worried and therefore work to calm down faster. If I'm feeling unsafe in an area of a place I've never been or if the airplane I'm on is experiencing a lot of turbulence, the panic attack is easier to get a grip on. Panic attacks with no real cause are tough because you're unsure of what set it off and then end up just worrying about everything.}}}

It's more physical than mental at this point, so my head feels totally clear while my body feels out of control until it's over. While my first ever panic attack, which lasted for four days straight, was triggered by a fight with my boyfriend at the time, many of my subsequent panic attacks have happened for no reason whatsoever (that I could discern, at least). For example, I've woken up to a panic attack in the middle of the night with no memory of a nightmare or anything else that might have induced it.Although I haven't had a panic attack in two years -- thanks to an SSRI that worked like a charm -- I'll always remember the pattern, which was very consistent:1. Entire body starts feeling shaky2. Pressure/pain in chest3. Vomiting4. Inability to keep down food or water5. Repeat steps 1-4 while waiting as patiently as possible for meds to kick in (this step applied only after I was officially diagnosed and before I was prescribed the SSRI)The worst part by far, for me, was the depressive aftereffect of the panic attack. Because I was so drained of adrenaline, I was always extremely depressed (physically and mentally) for days afterwards until my chemicals balanced themselves out again. Recovery took 2-3 weeks after my first panic attack, although after I was diagnosed I was able to get back to real life after only 2-3 days as a total vegetable. Having no history of depression and no concept of what it actually felt like, this absolutely terrified me the first time it happened; I had no idea why I felt so viscerally awful to the point where I had no will to live, could barely move, and had to literally be spoonfed by my parents. I won't go into any more detail because otherwise I'd feel compelled to post this anonymously, but it made the attack itself feel like a day in the park in comparison.As someone who has made a full recovery with no attacks for years now, anyone who has panic disorder and needs support, advice, or friendship is welcome to message me. I know how hard it is to find people to whom you can relate in this regard.}}}

Just imagine sheer terror, and there you go. More specifically:For me, I mostly have them at night. I'll wake up very suddenly with a feeling of complete and total terror. My heart will be racing, and I'll feel my heartbeat through my entire body -- especially in my chest, but basically anywhere -- my feet, my arms, my stomach, my head. I try to think through every horrible thing that might be causing it, but nothing ever seems like the right thing, like a thing justifying so much terror, and so I start to think it must be something else, something I don't know about yet. I start to think about all the horrible things that could possibly happen. Someone I love will die. I'll be arrested for smoking pot a few months ago. THE ENTIRE WORLD WILL END. If you've ever looked down from a high balcony and felt dizzy like you might fall over the railing, imagine if someone actually pushed you over.

[/edit]In one type, the kind I usually get, I start to panic about something.  Something, even if it's just a tiny bit of nausea, sets me off, and my thoughts spiral out of control and get worse and worse until all I can think about is that I want it to stop, I want it to go away.  This is frequently accompanied by thoughts of wanting to die to get rid of the feeling (it gets THAT bad sometimes).  Sometimes I start shaking, sweating, etc.  What sets me off frequently nowadays is that when I eat, I eat until my body tells me it's full by sending a tiny bit of nausea my way as a signal, so little that it's barely noticeable.  The problem is, I notice it, and it triggers my anxiety, which in turn makes me more nauseous, which makes me more anxious, and so on.  It's a really vicious cycle.  (That's not my only trigger, just one of them.)The other type I've only had two of, the second of which is occurring as I type this answer.  I have no idea what triggered this one (or the other one, which I had last night), but it's even worse than the other kind.  I feel shaky, very nauseous (so much so that I feel I can throw up at any moment), and my chest feels extremely tight and is in slight pain.  Emotionally, I feel like someone took a knife, stabbed me, and twisted it 360-degrees.  But in my emotions.  Basically the worst emotional pain I've ever felt in my life.All in all, it's not fun, either kind.  I have Xanax for when it gets too bad (I took it last night to kill that one), but there's always a risk of addiction with those types of drugs, so I use it only when absolutely necessary.}}}

At the time I didn't know what it was but it was triggered by realising that I had 'lost time' and had done things that I simply didn't remember doing.  Initially I experienced a shortness of breath and shallow breathing, sweating and weakness. I was on the phone at the time and I had to hang up because I couldn't speak. I felt a tightness and pain in my chest and throat and had to lay flat on my back until it started to pass (maybe 10mins). My doctor later told me this was a panic attack and I've continued to have attacks since then but the symptoms and causes have varied gradually.Most recently it starts with a subtle ache in my chest just below breast level. Once I've noticed this, it's virtually impossible to avoid a full blown attack. I think there's some kind of mental feedback loop going on - initially a negative one which escalates to a full attack and, coming out of it, a positive one as it passes.The ache becomes worse and I start to experience pain in my chest (which I initially thought was a heart attack - but my heart is fine) and a cramp-like pain in my abdomen. Other symptoms include a pain or lump in my throat which is either mildly painful when `I swallow or can prevent me from being able to eat or drink at all (when it occurs without other symptoms) .My body sweats, alternating hot and cold, with increasing numbness and tingling in my fingers/hands and toes/feet. I sometimes feel an urgent need to urinate and once, having done so, I passed out for a few seconds. Usually I need to find a bathroom so I can sit on the can - not because I necessarily need to use it but because it allows the freedom to relax as many muscles as possible, which helps.During this time the pain continues and can intensify. I can only describe it as the most painful experience I have ever had and I have experienced many broken bones, including femur and ribs which caused me to pass out from the pain, and this is worse. I'm not sure whether I feel like I'm going to die but I certainly don't care by that stage - I just want the pain to stop.I have various techniques for resolving the attacks which have changed over the years (I guess it's just in my mind but different ones have worked at different times - laying flat on my back on a bed/laying flat on my back on a hard surface/laying facedown in the recovery position/kneeling and sitting on my heels crouched over/walking continually in circles - once i feel the first signs of the pain easing it's like a green flag for recovery which is why I feel it's a mental feedback loop. I go from being completely incapacitated to full normality within a minute. Overall the attack lasts about 10-15 mins but it feels like it's never ending. I once had problems completing the recovery and kept triggering new pain - that was 2 hours of agony.Usually very very tired afterwards and just want to sleep.Mostly I'm not aware of specific triggers - they can happen anytime, relaxing in the evening, working at the office, driving (had to stop on the motorway and lay on the hard shoulder to recover!) or any place/time of day but I have a lot of continual stress and unconscious worries so it's probably triggers that I'm not consciously aware of.I've been on an SSRI (fluoxetine) since 2005 and a beta-blocker (propranolol) for the last few years. The attacks are not as frequent as they used to be but I'm still not free of them and doubt I will be until I can change the aspects of my life that are probably feeding them.}}}

The physical symptom was pronounced enough to make me mistook it for heart attacks in the beginning, but numerous tests later it was decided that at least my heart was okay. For me it always starts with a flutter of hastened heartbeats, followed by racing heart, tummy ache, diarrhea, dry month, difficulty to swallow, darkened vision and blurred hearing, extremely shallow breaths. It usually lasts for more than an hour, I would become unable to drive, strained to walk or do things.Mentally it felt like the world is closing in on me, and all concrete senses of reality is drifting away, other peoples' voices sounded like distant murmurs, my focus became extremely narrow and out of proportion, the sensation of being could almost be a zen moment, then I'd be occupied with an overwhelming fear that I'm dying. When the whole thing was over I'd be completely drained, empty, lonely and feel hopeless.A variety of SSRI helped me recover, now I am off SSRI, I still get some of the physical symptoms once in a while, but once I have convinced myself it's all in the mind, the fear became something I can control, which is the most important thing.}}}

The severity itself ranges according how mentally distraught I am. Smaller attacks might feel like sudden tightness in my chest and having a tingling sensation in my extremities. The more distraught I am, the more prominent the tingling sensation is. Sometimes it could even spread to my face, and I got to tell you, having tingling sensation on your face is not pleasant at all. When it's really bad, it feels like I'm losing control of my breathing and start hyperventilating, which actually makes me even more anxious. The most severe attack I've ever had happened several weeks ago. I was in a restaurant, when something upset me terribly. I was very vulnerable at the time, so I was not able to control myself as well as I could. It started just from crying, but I could not stop it. My chest felt like there's someone sitting on it, and it feels like I could not get as much air into my lungs as I should. Then the tingling sensation all over my body started to come. Starting 'normal' like the usual attacks but it gets more and more severe it felt more like a incessant spasm. The spasm centered in my stomach and radiates to the rest of my body. My stomach felt like there's molten lava in it and the spasm really felt painful. The spasm in my face was also bad that I couldn't move my lips to talk, and when I tried to talk nothing really came out. There's a sense of impending doom that I couldn't shake away, like there is no way I was able to get out of the hellish situation I was currently in and I don't know what to do. Things around me started to feel unreal. Like I was watching TV or something, I felt like I was not a part of the surroundings and felt more terrified when I realized I was actually a part of it. I did not even feel like I was a part of my external body. It's like my thoughts and my body is two separate entities and I have lost communications with my body. Getting my hands to move was awkward and took a long time. At what seems to be the 'peak', things started to drift away and I felt like I can pass out any time. The person I was with helped me 'snap out of it' and as I start to regain control of myself, the anxiety recede gradually. And then I fell asleep.It was a very terrifying experience. I didn't actually feel I was going to die, but it was definitely painful and emotionally and physically draining. I felt like I was trapped as if the walls were closing in on me and there is no way out.Valium really did help with the attacks, as it slows down my system. But since I stopped going to my psychiatrist, I have no way of getting a hold of the drugs. And besides, I don't want to be dependent on drugs. Partly because of shame, that I could not deal with my crazies on my own like everybody else, but also because of financial problems.}}}

Eventually I went to the hospital and after trying Ambien and Lunesta, they gave me Ativan and that controlled the symptoms. From then on panic attacks have beeen few and far between.

Also I felt tingling all over my body. Other that these minor issues I experienced no physical problems.Here is a story of my encounter. I was home alone. It began when I sat on the couch in the living room, holding the laptop. I didn't remember what I wanted to do with it, which startled me. Then I started feeling fuzzy, as if I were in a dream. I "snapped out" of the dream, but my new consciousness also felt as if it was a dream, so I tried to snap out of the new dream as well. Problem was that I couldn't concentrate and make sense of the world enough for me to see reality as being "real", i.e. I can't come to terms with whether or not I or anything was real anymore. Each time I came close to acknowledging my own existence, I slipped into a new dream like state deeper than the one before it. Eventually I gave up trying to assert my existence, and my consciousness started to fall apart.The loop of snapping out of dreams and into new ones continued indefinitely, without me being able to control it. It was as if my life was moving in scenes, each scene 10-20 seconds long. I experienced depersonalization and derealization at the same time, as well as short term memory loss. I couldn't remember anything from the previous scene, it was like exactly the movie Memento. My perceptions were unable to record anything around me, like the things I hear and see were not recorded - they were momentarily captured, like a camera shot, and then replaced by the next snap. At the back of my head there was something like a main consciousness which was trying to make sense of why my I was losing my sense of self awareness. It was observing my life and how my awareness was crashing while at the same time analyzing why it was. This was true fear, because when I was trying to think things through the problem was with the thinking agent. I couldn't think, but at the same time I could only think of not being able to think. I had no understanding of what I needed to do in order to think straight and make sense of things. I couldn't understand who I was, what I was doing, what is everything around me, what thought, existence, life, perception, reality, or what anything was. And I didn't know why I wanted to know all these things. This realization freaked me out, big time.}}}

However there is probably more going on than that.One of the early experiments with Prozac involved giving it to patients who were hospitalized with debilitating panic attacks. Two things happened. According to the staff, the patients stopped summoning them constantly for emergencies. So they thought that Prozac had been very effective. The patients, however, said that Prozac had done nothing for them. When asked why they weren't summoning the staff like they used to, the patients said that they were still having panic attacks, but they now realized the staff couldn't do anything to help them.There are many components to a panic attack. There is the physiological reaction: the sympathetic nervous system triggers adrenalin release, causing racing heart, sweating, etc.. There is also an emotional reaction: fear, concern, vigilance, caution. And there is a psychodynamic process overlaid onto the experience, which are the beliefs and narrative given to what is happening: the world is ending, I'm dying, someone is after me, the bridge is going to collapse. The story frames the fear, drives it forward, and locks it in as a temporary belief about the world; one momentarily loses the ability to perceive the fear as unfounded. All of these levels are intertwined and mutually reinforcing.One view on recovery, for example with Prozac or Xanax, is that the fear-driven reactive process can be suspended long enough to allow the individual to start to build a different belief framework around their fear experience. Later if the physiological response happens, they can frame it as a bodily reaction and not as an urgent truth regarding a real and present danger.}}}

If you have one and you are in immediate peril, then everything is working as it should. The problem happens when it kicks in and you are not genuinely in imminent physical danger. Certainly, this response is rarely helpful when your mind interprets a threat to your social well-being as being a threat to your very survival and responds accordingly, but that does happen. On a more detailed level, it is the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (noradrenaline) that fires up your brain, and its closely related succedent hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) that revs up your body, that are responsible for triggering the response. This is as opposed to being activated by the glucocorticoids (cortisol being the best known) which own the body's long-term stress response. Anxiety disorders each have their own unique signature profiles which can be defined by the relative presence of these two over time.}}}

It seems that the body's alarm system gets triggered without an obvious threat, ie, the mental and physical alertness that accompanies a threatening situation;they get activated in the absence of a threatening situation!! For treatment, one can take medications,like SSRIs,which have their range of side-effects and/or undergo therapy.}}}

Well this is done because the CBT model is solid, evidence based and comprehensively researched. It is also recommended by NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) for the treatment of many disorders, including anxiety.

A panic attack isn't just a feeling of impending doom and disaster but can also be associated with racing heart, sweatiness, dizziness, hyperventilation, a feeling of choking, etc. When a person induces these physical symptoms, they're potentially starting a sort of feedback loop- Your brain says "Heart's racing and can't breathe? Must be time to panic!" instead of "Panic time, start the heart going triple-time!" Of course a lot of people smoke cigarettes to calm themselves down, so on the one hand you've the stimulant (nicotine) that could be causing the symptoms versus the slow, deep breathing (very similar to what people do in meditative practice) to calm the symptoms. One cigarette might not do much, but chain-smoking could easily be a trigger.}}}

It just sounds like you're having really intense dreams and it takes a while for you to get your state of mind out of the dream. So it makes since as to why you still feel scared or in a panic state even after you are awake and that's okay those dreams sound intense. Are you stressed? If you've always had dreams like this you should try working out and just being really tired almost but a good tired when you go to sleep. Maybe you're just really stressed or worried about something if the dreams are new.I guess to answer your question or try to anyway, the amount of fear that you have is what is causing the panic attack or fear after you awake from your dream.So you're having symptoms of panic attacks that are caused by your dreams. Normally a panic attack would be feeling extreme worry or fear, being unable to breathe, you concentrate on your breathing and heart beat. Your chest can even start to hurt or your heart beats really fast.It could cause some people to cry or it can even cause depression (that much worry and fear can do that) You can feel trapped and like there's no escape.All of this can either happen randomly or it can be triggered, say if someone sees something or they're in a situation that overwhelms them. (like your dreams)If I have any advice it would be, just try to remember that it's a dream, and keep telling yourself that until you feel better, since you're having these symptoms look up ways to reduce panic attacks there's a lot of articles it'll help you.}}}

Instead, "panic attack" is used. A panic attack is a relatively brief period of very intense fear, typically characterized by some/all of the following: accelerated heart rate, dryheaving, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, fear of losing control, sense of impending death, derealization, etc. Panic attacks are thought to be related to the body's sympathetic response (aka fight-flight response). What begins as physiological hyperarousal may be catastrophically misinterpreted by the individual, which escalates the autonomic response, which leads to increased worry, ad infinitum. Fear is an aversive emotional response to something perceived to be immediately dangerous or threatening. It is concentrated on one situation, object, or person, but is less intense than a full-on panic attack. One definition for fear is "an alarm response to present or imminent danger (real or perceived)." Phobia is a term used to describe disproportionate, often irrational fear to something; the person goes to great lengths to avoid encountering this or else endures the experience with marked discomfort. The term anxiety is less intense still, and typically reserved for more generalized dysphoria, nervousness, and apprehension. Anxiety has been defined as "a future-oriented mood state associated with preparation for possible, upcoming negative events." The following quote helps to delineate fear from anxiety:"This view of human fear and anxiety is comparable to the animal predatory imminence continuum. That is, anxiety corresponds to an animal’s state during a potential predatory attack and fear corresponds to an animal’s state during predator contact or imminent contact." [1]As of the DSM-IV-TR, all of the following disorders exist under the Anxiety Disorders umbrella:Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)Panic Disorder (PD)AgorophobiaSpecific phobiaSocial phobiaObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)Acute stress disorderFear or anxiety become a disorder when the response becomes pathological -- that is, causing significant impairment or marked distress.Sources:[1] http://www.dsm5.org/Research/Doc...}}}

As a husband, what can I do to help her when she seems pretty driven to deliberately do the things that make it worse? }}},{{{Of course, I can't answer such a question specifically for an individual, as the causes of panic attacks are so many and varied, that without a detailed personal consultation it would be impossible to be certain. Quora can never be a substitute for a consultation with a trained professional, and what I say here should not be taken as such.  The principles of anxiety, though, are based in the fact that it is generally a useful emotion. If you were stood on a clifftop in a gale, you would feel anxiety and that anxiety would motivate you to move away from the edge and increase your survival chances. You would never consult a physician in these circumstances because the anxiety would be clearly explicable to all. When anxiety happens without obvious reason, we tend to call this a panic attack, anxiety disorder or anxiety neurosis. I would assert, though, that the distinction is not clear cut; they are both normal endocrine reactions to a perceived threat. The skill in the latter case is identifying what that threat is.  The second principle of anxiety is that it is a warning system which kicks in at too low a threshold to make it a completely reliable trigger to make us alter actions as a result of it; that is, it is an alarm which goes off to tell you something might be dangerous, rather than telling you something definitely is dangerous. There is a high false-positive rate. This is understandable evolutionarily, as a set of genes that tells you to run away at the merest hint of danger will avoid danger more effectively than a set of genes which encourage you to sit and think about how bad the danger is; eventually there will be a danger which doesn't allow you time to sit and think, so over many generations, the latter kind will be less likely to propagate. So we are left with minds which perceive threat and default to anxiety unless our past experience has taught us not to be anxious.  Experience is important here because it is very difficult to think your way out of anxiety – if something is anxiety-provoking, you can’t use logic to make the anxiety disappear as easily as you can use experience. We know this through exposure therapy for specific phobias such as arachnophobia. If you are exposed to the thing that makes you anxious at a distance or intensity that makes you anxious enough to feel it, but not so anxious you have to run away, then the anxiety will eventually subside. If you repeat this process, you can have a spider walking up an arachnophobic’s arm within a few hours.  Quite a good analogy here is a cricket ground. (If you’re not familiar with cricket, then a) you should be as it’s the best game in the world, and b) there isn’t really another game I know of that has similar moveable boundary markings, except Australian Rules football, which is played on – yes – a cricket pitch). Typically, the boundary of a cricket ground is marked with a rope running around the ground’s circumference. The grounds are roughly circular and most of the play happens in the middle. Imagine you are standing in the middle, and all the ground inside the rope is your safe zone in which you don’t feel anxious, and all the ground outside the rope is stuff that makes you feel anxious. The difference between a cricket ground and anxiety, though, is that it is evolutionarily efficient to keep the pitch small, and avoid danger, as long as it is not so small you never get out to eat or to reproduce. So the rope has a tendency to move inwards all the time. The thing that keeps it out there at the boundary is experience. If you take a step across the rope and wait, eventually the rope will move away from the action in the middle, and you will have a greater area of safety zone. If, though, you never step across the rope, it has a tendency to drift inwards, and things you used to find OK become anxiety provoking again – ask anyone who starts dating again in their 50s… Situations such as your wife’s then (and again I’m repeating that this cannot be certain to be the right answer in her case – you should get her to see someone for a personal answer) is that it is not a deliberate choice to do things that make the overall picture worse. It is a choice to do things that make the “now” better. Patients often spend a lot of their time choosing to step back inside the rope, because it feels so bad to take even one step across it. In your example, going for a run sounds like crossing the rope – it is resisted, and it feels good when it’s over and she’s back inside the rope. Similarly, the comfort of being in the warmth of the company of friends and family can feel good at the time, but can, paradoxically, put time away from that comfort the wrong side of the rope, making the overall picture worse.  One way to help people in this situation is firstly not to view their rope as being in the same position as yours. No two people’s ropes are in the same place, and you can’t begin to understand a patient by walking in your own shoes. Together, find where the rope is for her. Define what is on one side and what is on the other. Then what you have to do is to find a step small enough that you cross her rope (with her) so that she feels anxiety, but not such a big one that she has to jump straight back across the rope to safety. Then, and this is crucial, you wait. Don’t go back across the rope until the anxiety has gone – it might take hours – and don’t push the rope harder either until the anxiety has gone. The rope moves at the pace it moves, not the pace you want it to move. You must stay where you are until it has moved. Move forwards too quickly and she will jump back to safety. Move backwards too quickly and the relief of being back in the safe zone will make the rope heavier and harder to push next time. You have to wait for the ground you are standing on to become the safe zone.  This is hard. For her and for you. It will feel painfully slow at times to you, but that is not because she is weak or sabotaging her care, but because you haven’t crossed your own rope. Patients who appear to be sabotaging their care are usually not doing that, but they are being taken too far across the rope in one go. This is a failure not of the patient, but of the therapist. For some patients, “being ill” is the only safe zone they have, and the idea of “being well” only exists outside the rope. If this situation exists then you need specialist help, probably on a one-to-one basis.  There are many decent books on anxiety and its management, but none of these are as good as the advice of a professional, so, at the risk of being repetitive, please don’t read this as irrefutable truth: it can’t be when we have never met. But do try to understand the anxiety of others without clouding your view with your own perception of what is a threat and what isn’t.}}}

You can't blame her falling a little back with her parents, they make her feel secure and understood and don't push her, which would cause her stress level to go high. Try to be understanding and don't give up trying with her, she does need a little push here and there, just don't over do it. There will be times of 2 steps forward and then 1 step back, don't expect too much, it can be a very long road ahead. Don't be the one who pushes her back because you are frustrated with her, even though you have good intentions you could create more damage if you don't watch yourself. Just be supportive always. Baby steps, know when to give a nudge and when to let it go. Don't expect much during PMS times, hormones and emotions can be too much around that time to accomplish something that is a high stress trigger, so be aware.}}}

I know it's easier said than done but you don't want to have any anticipatory attacks which are panic attacks stemming from worrying about having another panic attack. Not fun. Also try to stay away from caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine if possible. All of those things can trigger panic attacks (and quickly at that). Like Juli said, see a doctor. Try to find a practice that has both psychologists and psychiatrists as they're easier to work with. You should see a psychologist first who will help try to figure out the cause, work with you on coping skills, breathing exercises, and understanding. They will be able to help you figure out if meds are the next course of action and can refer you to a psychiatrist (though you might not even need that). Psychologists are amazing people and can honestly do wonders for anxiety and panic. They will give you the most valuable resources for you to deal with/help manage attacks and that's what's really important.Important: Trust your doctors but also trust your body. If a psychiatrist puts you on a medication that is making you worse, having bad side effects, etc, make sure you let them know. My first psychiatrist was adamant on trying and keeping me on several antidepressants for my panic attacks (I have panic disorder, but am not depressed) and they made my anxiety worse/had bad side effects to the point I couldn't handle it. My psychologist saw this and ended up referring me to a different psychiatrist. He put me on a different type of medication (not anti-depressants, strictly for anxiety and such) which I only take as needed and I feel a lot better. Everyone is different and what works for me may not work for someone else with the same disorder and vice-versa. I know they can be scary but with a little help you'll start feeling a lot better! Good luck :)}}}

Maybe there was something I was reacting to.  After the results were in it turned out I have way fewer allergies than I did when I was young. Nice to know. Not allergies.Then I came up with a plan. I'd sit down to eat, take a bite and when my heart started racing and I felt "funny" I'd clamp my mouth shut and take 5 deep, slow breaths through my nose, just to prove that nothing was swelling up. That also calmed my heart down. I'd look at my wife and ask her to look at my eyes and lips and tell me if anything looked odd. When nothing did, I'd breathe until was felt fine. Then I'd take another bite, and breathe. then another, until the entire episode passed.Eventually, the panic attacks became an issue only at that first bite, then fewer foods, then hardly at all.Now, they happen very, very rarely, but when they do, I breathe, slowly and deeply, until they pass.I hope this helps!}}}

Are you suffering?  If you aren't happy and you're suffering more than you think is sustainable or positive, then it is probably a good time to think about making some changes.  (I wrote more about this point in my comment under Carl Stone's response.)  A lot of people think mental illness falls into a completely separate category of mental experiences from "normal" experiences, but in reality, most of the time, there are pretty clear - even if not always immediately obvious - links between "mental illness" and people's lives, whether present lives or past experiences.

And I am having a panic attack right now. Before the atheism , the idea of god was a common way for me to calm myself down. How should i calm myself about anxiety for the future without again falling back on divine intervention/prayer?I note that you have asked this anonymously. In my experience, yours is not a question asked by most atheists, It is a question asked by theists who do not understand atheism.When you say, "I just turned atheist this year," I wonder what you mean by that. Do you mean that you have come to the realization that you have no belief in any god or gods? Because that is not a "turning," it is a state of being, like the color of your eyes or your height or your sex.Once one realizes one has no belief in any god or gods, it is impossible to "fall back on divine intervention/prayer," because one has no belief that there is anything to intervene or pray to. That's why there are atheists in foxholes (or in battle) and few to no atheists fall victim to deathbed conversions. We simply have no reason to believe it would change anything.If you have anxiety for the future, that could well be an emotional problem quite apart from a lack of belief in any god or gods. You might want to invest in a complete physical checkup, including admitting your anxiety about the future to your healthcare professional. You might also want to consider whether you are in fact atheist. If religious belief is a comfort to you, why did you give it up? Perhaps you're just unhappy with the religion you inherited, or with the people involved, or with someone close to you who is religious. If it makes you happier, by all mean, believe.If, on the other hand, you have arrived at a lack of belief in any god or gods, own it. Use your name. Join the community of Quora atheists. Tell others about how and why you have come to the realization that you have no belief in any god or gods. There are several questions asking about this.

That was, as you know, the preferred catharsis of the divine leader of us atheists, Christopher Hitchens (God bless his soul). If it doesn't seem to suit you, you could always try substance abuse, thievery, adultery, or any other similarly relaxing activities. I prefer coveting personally, which, as you know, is very popular among us lawless atheists. Particularly neighbors' wives.In seriousness, I would recommend that you don't look for a way to 'calm yourself down' and face the truth, whatever it is. I use the word in its loosest sense, that is, being true to one's emotions. Don't suppress your fears/anxieties, meet your panic attack headlong and scrutinize it until it appears silly. I find many (secular) Buddhist practices to be useful in this regard, particularly forms of meditation such as vipassana (note: this is not an alternative opiate, it is the very opposite)Essentially, don't run away from it, whether your method be religion or drugs. Panic attacks, though unpleasant, can be very useful and instructive. Even character-building. As another on of our unholy prophets, Friedrich Nietzsche, wrote: What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.Or, of course you could pray for your panic attacks to go away, and worst-case scenario (it actually does kill you) you could hope for an afterlife of eternal joy.}}}

It feels worse when I'm alone. I've always tried to hide it from everyone but it makes me looks like a mad person for always keep checking on my sides, behind my back, or do I did something wrong or do I miss something important. It's mostly happened during my daily activities, like turning the lights off that I need to walk in the dark to my room, or standing beside my bed and suddenly become so aware of the empty space under the bed. This feeling is so disturb me.I can't focusing on something that I should do instead of checking on the tiny details, unless I convinced myself enough that everything's alright and I am safe, which most of the time is a hard work to be done.Also there are times when I can be relaxed among crowd or inversely, got all panic and nervous. Though I think it maybe a different thing. }}},{{{This sounds like it could be anxiety. Does this match what you are experiencing? If anxiety becomes pronounced, it can express itself in various ways. For example, you may have trouble falling asleep; dwell on a particular situation and find it difficult to think of something else; feel tense, restless, jittery, dizzy and sweaty; have trouble concentrating; overeat or lose your appetite; be overly vigilant and startle easily; have a feeling of impending disaster, as if "something bad is going to happen;" or are depressed (anxiety can mask depression).}}}

The anxiety, fear and panic will escalate until it reaches a high and then it will drop off. It can take anywhere from a few minutes to over an hour for it to get to a point where the adrenaline will wear off. You'll feel drained mentally, emotionally, and physically. Having your anxiety and fears lead to an attack is exhausting, and you'll sometimes feel like you can sleep forever.Breathing exercises and guided imagery can help to lessen anxiety, which in turn can help bring down the attack. That said, it's obviously much easier said than done.}}}

The best way I found to cure this feeling was through experience. The more I did it, the less difficult it became.Here are some tips:1. Try not to overthink your sales presentations in advance of the call. Simply make a basic outline of what you want to present, and speak naturally about each point.2. Remind yourself that you will be ok at the end of the call regardless of the outcome. Picture yourself ending the call: think about the relief you will feel at a mission accomplished. This will build your confidence.3. Make as many calls as possible. Practice makes perfect.I hope this helps.}}}

However, there are many steps you can take to ease the pain and slow the process time. I'll share with you what worked for me. 1) go to the doctor. I went to a GP, internist, neurologist, and cardiologist and had a sleep study done. I had about 50 tests run and all showed that I was fine. So the point is you want to make sure there's isn't something physically wrong first. Luckily, mine was not  physical (although it felt like it). Finally the internist prescribed me a healthy dose of Wellbutrin (300 mg) which took about 6 weeks to kick in, but really helped! I didn't know it, but I was depressed and the depression was manifesting itself in these awful moments of terror and doom.2) go see a therapist/psychiatrist. I immediately set up an appointment with a licensed therapist and I have to say I highly recommend therapy! For obvious reasons.......3) exercise. I joined the gym, started going to classes (Zumba, spin, supreme body challenge) and met some really great people! I also lost 50 pounds!4) try to cut out bad habits.     The day I had my first panic attack, I actually thought I was having a heart attack and I called the ambulance! They looked at me like I was crazy when they took my vitals and told me I was fine. Needless to say, the very next day I quit smoking and drinking. I'm too young (31) to feel like I'm having a heart attack so why treat my body this way?5) practice meditation or yoga. This will help you find an inner peace you thought you never had. I promise. I signed up for qi gong, which is kind of like tai chi. I swear this class balanced me and helped calm me down. 6) find a support group. Unfortunately, I didn't have much support during my low period, because my family and friends thought I was faking or overreacting. Honestly I don't blame them! I wouldn't have wanted to be around me either, I was a mess. But I finally had an aunt that really listened to me, gave me advice. She was my only rock during this time. Look for support groups and friends. I guarantee you know someone that is going through the same thing. Or has gone through the same thing and they will have great advice7) do your research. I googled and googled and googled and there are plenty of articles, explanations, people out there that understand/are going through what you are going through. This made me feel better! For a long time, I felt like the loneliest person on the planet. There are apps on the iPhone that help calm you down during a panic attack. These helped me a little, but they could help you more!In conclusion, i never got an answer to why I was having panic attacks. It doesn't run in my family (sometimes it's hereditary) and I didn't have anything major happen (I.e. PTSD) and I finally realized the answer is not black and white! We may never know why this happens to us, but I read somewhere that people who have panic attacks are unique because we have an active imagination, so we really are creative individuals. Try to fuel your creativity into something. I haven't yet found my creative niche yet, but am still looking!Don't give up and I really hope you (and others) read this and it helps!}}}

There are also some good subjective suggestions for handling a panic attack in the moment. I will add my voice to that. Although meditation and other calming activities may help stanch an impending-feeling attack, when things have gone over the line into a full-blown, I have found one thing that can douse it: Anger!Your mileage may vary, and there are many viewpoints on the causes and "pathology" of an attack, but some research suggests that a general sense of passive helplessness is at the root of panic attacks. When in the throes of one, I have found it helpful to reflect on something - anything - that makes me angry. In my case, something that I perceive as unjust usually works. I allow myself to get pissed off, righteously incensed, and to externalize that as much as is appropriate for my surroundings. I clench my fists, curse, scream. It is amazing how this can throw a wet blanket on an attack.Some have success in invoking the mammalian diving response by splashing water on their face, and particularly back of their neck. I also wet my ears. I then stand near or under a fan to get a quick cool-off.Jumping in the shower helps me.I learned early on that I can not go around indignant all the time just to stem panic attacks. The blood pressure would get me on the other end. But in a pinch, it works.I have not had a full-blown attack in over 2 years.}}}

So I let the panic attacks control my life by avoiding putting myself in that situation. I just accepted that this was something that I would deal with for the rest of my life. I hated the fact that I was missing out on things but my fear of another attack was more profound. It was 2 years ago that I had a revelation which seemed to resolve my attacks. Within a 2 month period, I had to deal with the death of my father and my mother's diagnoses of cancer and didn't have an attack once. I realised that if I didn't panic at a time when I was at my most stressed, frightened, vulnerable and emotionally drained then what did I ever need to panic about?I just wanted to share some coping techniques that I found useful:- When you feel an attack coming or in an attack, find something to distract your brain/thought pattern. I found watching a film or going for a drive worked best as it would interrupt my thought pattern.- Tell people in your life about this as they want to help and support you. I didn't practice what I am preaching as I felt silly and weak and wouldn't let anyone know about what I was going through. I didn't want to burden anyone with a shaking, hyperventilating, vomiting, crying mess but my friends and family couldn't bear the thought that I would suffer these attacks alone.- Just go with it. If you want cry, scream, lie on the floor in fear - do it! I used to do whatever made me feel better (in my case, vomiting felt like I was pushing the panic out of my body) and don't feel stupid or weak about it afterwards.I hope that what I have said can give you some comfort that you are not alone and that there may come a day when panic attacks are a distant memory.Good luck and I sincerely wish you the very best.}}}

I have no medical qualification whatsoever.Now, there are two areas we need to think about:How to minimize the impact of a panic attack once you start getting oneHow to prevent them from occurring in the first placeLet's first go with 2 (Prevention):First of all please get the necessary tests done to be certain that the problem is not physical in nature. Any doctor can prescribe you the tests that need to be doneTry to sit and list down all the problems, anxieties that you are facing. Try to see if you can see some cause-effect relationship between them. Are there any specific triggers everytime you get one? Often a lot of our anxieties stem from one or two basic challenges or problems we are facing. Once you identify the root causes, try to tackle them. Ask for help if necessary. The exercise of identifying the root causes will brief some clarity and relief in itself. This exercise is important since panic attacks usually feel like an unknown, overpowering gloom consuming you and once you are aware of your basic anxieties that might be causing those attacks, those attacks will lose the element-of-unknown fearAt the same time, you need to do some breathing exercise daily. Even 15 minutes per day will have a lot of mood-elevating effects. In the initial phase, try to practice twice a day. There are a lot of techniques you can read about online to help you with this (For example, you can try basic Pranayama). The idea behind any of these techniques is to take slow, deep deliberate breaths. If you can meditate with some healing visualizations then that should help a lot too. Be patient with these efforts and with time you will see the differenceIn my opinion, do not take medication unless absolutely necessary. The act of taking medicines itself sometimes can make you feel "there is something wrong with you". If you are under medication, then try to phase those out with help from the doctor, supplementing those with breathing exercises and a healthier lifestyle, which brings me to the next point:Sleep a lot and exercise. Go for a run or hit the gym.Now let's talk about 1 (How to minimize impact if you get an attack)If you are driving, operating machinery etc., then immediately get into a safe position to minimize any potential hazards. It is advisable that you sit or lie down as opposed to standing.Start breathing deeply. Take a long breath, hold, slowly release. And repeat. Do not start panting for breath. Do not hold your breath too long. Do not "forget" to breathe in those overpowering momentsChange your surrounding if you can. Sometimes even a small thing like whistling a tune helps. You basically have to snap out of the vicious cycle of fear from experiencing irrational fear...Please be aware that panic attacks are more common than most of us think. It is neither a handicap nor a limiting factor. If you can address the core anxieties/problems in your life and at the same time lead a healthy lifestyle, you will be able to cope with the attacks easily and eliminate them totally.Take it as an opportunity to detox your life.}}}

Why does it occur? }}},{{{Sorry to hear that Wikipedia must have been down.Here's the link, and an excerpt: Panic attackPanic attacks are periods of intense fear or apprehension that are of sudden onset[1] and of variable duration from minutes to hours. Panic attacks usually begin abruptly, may reach a peak within 10 minutes, but may continue for much longer if the sufferer had the attack triggered by a situation from which they are not able to escape. In panic attacks that continue unabated, and are triggered by a situation from which the sufferer desires to escape, some sufferers may make frantic efforts to escape, which may be violent if others attempt to contain the sufferer. Some panic attacks can subside on their own over the next several hours. Often, those afflicted will experience significant anticipatory anxiety and limited symptom attacksin between attacks, in situations where attacks have previously occurred. The effects of a panic attack vary. Some, notably first-time sufferers, may call for emergency services. Many who experience a panic attack, mostly for the first time, fear they are having a heart attack or a nervous breakdown.[2] Experiencing a panic attack has been said to be one of the most intensely frightening, upsetting, and uncomfortable experiences of a person's life and may take days to initially recover from.[3] Repeated panic attacks are considered a symptom of panic disorder.[4] Screening tools like Panic Disorder Severity Scale can be used to detect possible cases of disorder, and suggest the need for a formal diagnostic assessment.[5][6]}}}

Anxiety can be treated with medication and/or therapy. Some of the best self-help techniques are meditation, yoga, and/or exercise. Personally, I find dance and music (as participatory endeavors) to be very helpful, although the relief is temporary.Medications can last a life time, but they don't always. You can learn to cope with your issues using other techniques that are just as effective as medication. I see medication as a kind of emergency intervention that will stabilize you until you can learn how to cope on your own. Sometimes you can learn to cope quickly (within a few years) and sometimes it take decades. Some folks never are sufficiently able to cope without meds. You don't know which person you will be before you've worked on your problem.If you think you might have bipolar disorder, you should talk to a psychiatrist. If they do diagnose you, they may or may not provide medications for the anxiety. They may try to focus on the mood disorder, with the idea that if they treat that, the anxiety will go away, too. Or they may give you something for anxiety if that is bothering you a lot.Whatever you do, I hope you will see someone if you are experiencing discomfort. Anxiety is very uncomfortable, to say the least. You deserve relief, whether you believe it or not. There is no suffering competition you can win here. Just get help, please.}}}

After eating, I felt very little, and I went to sleep.  I woke up feeling nauseous. I vomited. I literally felt like I might die. I had my then-roommate call 911.  I was sitting on the floor of her room. I felt like I couldn't breathe. There was a fluttering in my chest. I really felt like I couldn't breathe. Anyway, an ambulance came. I told them I was afraid I was going to die. They took my vitals and told me they were ok. And they told me it was probably a panic attack.I didn't even know you could overdose on weed. I guess when they tell you that, they mean you can't die from it. But, according to results from google, you can have a panic attack and think you're dying!Which experience was worse in the moment? Panic attack.However, anxiety attacks suck, too, and with them there's the factor that you're NOT feeling like you're dying, and you just feel like (or I felt like) I just had to suck it up.

And also, it takes a very very long time to go away. Why is this happening suddenly? }}},{{{Anxiety is a serious issue. Anxiety is essentially long term stress – and stress is damaging to the mind and body. Stress causes DNA damage – quite literally damage to each and every one of your cells, and anxiety can potentially put you at risk for cancers, organ failure, memory loss, and more.In the short term, anxiety is damaging as well. Regular, persistent anxiety causes fatigue and negative thinking that takes away from any of life's joys. It may also cause physical symptoms like nausea, indigestion, and muscle acne that can make it difficult to remain active.Overall, when you experience anxiety regularly, it is something that needs to be treated. The only way to treat it is to make sure you're not causing it, and one common item that people claim causes anxiety is coffee.Coffee can lead to a feeling of being jittery and an increased heart rate. It's possible to drink coffee and not have any of these experiences. It's also possible to have anxiety and feel jitters every day.Coffee may contribute to anxiety, but it's rarely the only symptom or cause. It's possible that one of the reasons that a link is considered present is because anxiety is a subjective experience. Most people can feel caffeine when it gets into their system. Those that feel it and are asked about their anxiety levels may simply be attributing their extra energy to anxiety retroactively. Anxiety is a subjective experience, and generally subjective experiences make for inconsistent anecdotal evidence.Furthermore, it's possible that studies about the effects of caffeine do not take into account tolerance. It's possible (although once again, the research doesn't support this claim) that those that have not had caffeine in the past react strongly to the drug more than those that are tolerant. This could also create a feeling of energy that is attributed to anxiety, but is generally nothing more than caffeine related energy.What you add to your caffeinated beverages could affect anxiety as well. Refined sugars can be harmful to the body, so sodas and heavily sugared caffeinated drinks may not be ideal.All of these could potentially link caffeine and anxiety, as well as coffee and anxiety, but none of them are evidence that coffee causes generalized anxiety – only that there are reasons that others may subjectively report anxiety while on caffeine.Those that live with anxiety deal with a considerable amount of stress every day. That stress can have a powerful effect on day to day living, and those that suffer from that level of anxiety should consider everything they can to improve their quality of life.If this means you want to try cutting out caffeine from your diet, then you should cut caffeine from your diet. The potential anxiety benefits of caffeine are mild at best, and people react differently to different dietary changes, so it may be worthwhile quitting caffeine and seeing if your anxiety feels like it is decreasing.Nevertheless, research has yet to show a strong link between coffee and anxiety, and other research seems to show the opposite effect – that not only does caffeine not effect anxiety, it could benefit it as well. As long as you're limiting your caffeine consumption to healthy levels and not suffering from panic attacks, there's little reason to believe that you need to stop drinking that next cup of coffee.}}}

Here is an approach to discovering what is going on:First of all, please see your internist/medical doctor/primary caregiver. You need to rule out any physical causes such as disease, hormonal changes, etc.Next, please see someone -- regularly -- who is credentialed with experience in counseling people who feel panic if you feel that this interferes with your quality of life, or ability to work. Choose what works for you -- I like dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) to design replacement activities instead of lying on the couch waiting for the panic to subside, and so there is an inventory of panic triggers and go-to activities when the panic first hits and I first become aware of its increasing hold on me.Finally, take a self-inventory. This is the part I can help you with because I have self-inventoried. If, like me, you experienced repeated, severely traumatic event(s), it may very well be that you similarly find that your resiliency diminishes with exposure to trauma. This means that the more trauma we experienced in our past, the longer it takes to recover -- and the more intensely we feel the impacts from current trauma. Think of when you were smaller and skinned your knee. If you re-injured the knee before the scab had a chance to heal, it seemed to hurt more intensely the second time it was injured, and it seemed to take longer to heal. Trauma is trauma, be it physically or emotionally experienced -- or both.Complex PTSD can occur from repeated traumatic incidents over time. In my case, it includes being in danger from bullets flying, rapes, and from childhood sexual abuse (CSA). CSA alone for example, can manifest later with panic attacks, anxiety, excessive startle reflexes, difficulty sleeping, difficulty concentrating... for more information about CSA, see www.theinnocencemission.org. For more about PTSD, see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubm....Panic is usually a symptom of something else -- please find out what it is. When we address our underlying needs, our symptoms resolve with time, love, and appropriate care.Be good to yourself. Find whatever is sufficient to address your needs. Life is good, and it is up to us to manifest that goodness however we can. This is hard to do while breathless and laid out on the couch from a panic attack. Believe me, I know.One final important thought: the past does not have to equal the future. When we change, we can stop fear in its tracks and replace it with expression (art, writing, music, talking), physical activity (rhythmic hiking, physical movement of all kinds, dancing, etc), and focus elsewhere (caring for others). Step out of your comfort zone even when you are frightened. Bring a friend for support if you want company.}}}

This is for the panic attack -- the situation where you get the extreme symptoms. Mild symptoms can last longer than that, on and off even a full day. In your question you've mentioned this has happened in the early morning, shortly after you woke up. When we physically wake up, our minds are still not fully awake. A panic attack is where you get the 'panic/horror' symptoms without a reasonable event that would make you get those symptoms. When your mind realize you're not actually sick and that's just a panic attack, the symptoms slowly fade away and you calm down. So after you wake up, since your mind is not fully awake yet, it's normal for a panic attack to last long. Also, assuming you took an hours-long sleep and didn't eat or drink anything during that time, you must have been hungry and dehydrated. When this is the case, panic attack symptoms (feeling like there's something physically wrong going on) is very normal. Your mind mistakes the normal 'sleepiness + hunger' with 'being sick' and that fires a panic attack.I first suggest you to take a medical test just to be sure everything is all right. If there's nothing physically wrong, therapy does help for anxiety disorder. I should know...I have suffered anxiety disorder in my early 20s and was completely agoraphobic for a month.Until then, and after you get a doctor confirm that really was a panic attack, here are some tips:"I checked my heart rate because I felt my heartbeat in my whole body and it was 120 just lying down there."Just lying there is good for couple minutes, if you just lie there doing nothing for longer, you are basically listening to your body. Panic attacks love attention, more you listen to your body, your heartbeats, your breathing, worse the panic attack will get. Even a person who has no anxiety disorder problem would lose his breathing tempo if he listened to his breaths, and very likely would feel the need to take a deep breath in the end. So, don't just lie down. Instead, distract your mind. When I use to get major panic attacks, every time I started to feel I can't breath, I quickly opened a comedy video on YouTube. It doesn't miraculously solve the problem in a second, but surely helps and shortens the length of panic attack.Don't let your mind make this a big deal. In other words, don't fear of having another panic attack because you had this one. Just remember this as something like dark comedy, laugh about it. When I learned to do that myself, the number of attacks I had got significantly lower. I hope you feel better soon. :-)}}}

At the root of your problem are the inaccurate thoughts of eminent danger that accompany the events you described. You're finding yourself in certain situations that trigger these thoughts that end up causing these symptoms. Medication can help, but is certainly not the only way. You would still have those automatic thoughts that will need to get unlearned. The "cure" can involve a number of things. Being aware of those thoughts, why you have them, and why they are not accurate representations of reality is a start. Reminding yourself of what makes them inaccurate every time you're in those situations can help (ex: this microwave has been used over 300 times by different people and has not blown up...so it likely won't blow up today). Other strategies can involve how you manage the symptoms when you have them, like teaching yourself controlled breathing or deep muscle relaxation. A key to all of this is to not avoid those situations that trigger these symptoms...keep forcing yourself to do them, while you challenge the negative thoughts and manage the stress. Again, maybe a licensed psychologist can help. Hope this helps.}}}

In your case, it seems, at least from what you wrote that it's just the thoughts. Panic attacks usually include rapid heartbeat, feeling displaced, sweating, nausea and other physical symptoms. In your case, it sounds like paranoia. What I would recommend is take a couple (no more than 3) deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth, and ask yourself what is true. For example: it is true that I am standing here wearing red shoes. It is true that I feel the breeze on my face. It is true that I am sitting here rubbing my index finger and thumb together. It is true that I hear a dog barking nearby. Once you focus on what is real, that is called living in the moment and being rational rather than conjuring up what ifs. Good luck and be well.}}}

Panic attacks tend to feed on themselves, much like feedback loops that happen with acoustics (e.g., when a live microphone is placed too close to a speaker, you end up hearing that high-pitched squeal). Just as moving the microphone away from the speaker will stop the feedback, distracting yourself and thinking of something else will help de-escalate your panic attack. In a panic attack, your sympathetic nervous system (SNS) kicks in. This is the bodily reaction that prepares you for "fight or flight". All of the symptoms (increased heart rate, respirations, blood pressure, sweating, etc.) are there, and when you feel them coming on it creates additional stress. By counting your teeth, breathing from your diaphragm (deep belly breaths) and asking a friend for reassurance (holding a hand, rubbing your back, telling you it is a panic attack and it will pass) can be sufficient distraction. But because the fight or flight reaction kicks in, you may end up forgetting these coping methods - unless you practice them. So when you are in a calm state of mind, in a place that gives you a sense of security and peace, practice distraction. Tell yourself, "When I feel a panic attack coming on, I will distract myself like this ..." And then practice the distracting measures until they are second nature. One more thing: if you are prone to having panic attacks, some sessions with a therapist who does EMDR or brain-spotting can be very helpful to dig in, find the root cause and separate your emotions from the trigger. And in some cases, a benzodiazepine (Xanax, Ativan) can help keep you chilled out when going into situations that may trigger you. * I learned this from a kindergarten teacher last week; she teaches it to kids when they start to get out of control. I almost blew a fuse yesterday, but counting my teeth chilled me right out. Having had one wicked panic attack in the past, I know that this action would be something that can get your mind to focus elsewhere.}}}

Remind yourself that your thoughts are only thoughts, not facts. Remind yourself of all the times you have had panic attacks and these things haven't happened. BreatheThe fight/flight response that is responsible for panic attacks is further fuelled by hyperventilating. Breathe deeply (you can ensure you are doing this by putting a hand on your chest and a hand on your stomach, so that you can ensure that you are filling your lungs completely by watching the hand on your stomach raise more than the one on your chest). Find your own rhythm, but counteract the excess of oxygen you get through hyperventilating by ensuring that you breathe out for longer than you breathe in. Most Importantly, Stay in the SituationPanic attacks are driven by fear which is usually triggered by specific situations. Whatever that situation is for you, the worst thing you can possibly do is escape it. This is because when you avoid or escape from that situation, you are proving to yourself that it is something to fear and that you are unable to cope with it, i.e. you are reinforcing the unhelpful thinking that you need to challenge.  The fight/flight response is driven by your sympathetic nervous system, so it is instinctual. However, what is also inbuilt is the eventual response of our parasympathetic nervous system which calms our bodies down. So if you stay in the situation, it will be frightening and unpleasant for awhile, but it will eventually pass. And, crucially, the next time you face that situation will be less frightening. Eventually you won't fear that situation enough to be at risk of a panic attack.  If you have been avoiding the triggers of your panic attacks for a long time,  use a gradual approach to exposing yourself to them again. Think of small steps that you can take to face up to your fears (i.e. if you are afraid of crowded spaces, you could choose to work your way up from small shops to large shops, and/or from less busy times to peak times). Ensure that when you choose a step, that you commit to it and do not leave the situation until your anxiety reduces in intensity by at least half. Then always repeat ,repeat, repeat!  ------------------------------------------------These principles are all based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. So if you need help, pick up a self help book or see a therapist who specialises in CBT.}}}

First things first. All of the following are mutually exclusive when it comes to mental health:FastEffectivePermanentIn fact the last one isn't ever really attainable in the sense that almost all depression and anxiety can't be cured (just like diabetes and addiction can't be cured). However if you are willing to change your lifestyle you can "permanently" get your condition under control and have a totally normal and functional life.As Jack Bennet's superb answer (which I won't try to compete with) lays out, there's no "one" thing, and certainly no magic pill. However you need to do at least these things:See a mental health professional - regularly at first (no, once a year is not regularly, nor is once a month)Take their advice and act on it (yes, really)If you're prescribed medication, take it in exactly the manner and frequency prescribed (no, you really don't know better. And no, you aren't better now.)Exercise more (it's never as bad as you imagine)Eat healthierLook hard at the people in your life and decide if they are helping or hurting youFind a passion and practice it (mine's writing)Now, to be clear here, I don't always (or even often) follow my own advice. But when I don't I pay the price (feeling anxious) and when I do I reap the rewards (not feeling anxious). If you're anything like me then you're stubborn and fearful and more than a little self destructive. That's natural and not something to be ashamed of. If you slip, get back on the horse, and give yourself a break. Try to recognise that you're a good person who's just trying their best to make their way through a complicated and often scary world. You deserve to feel ok. Hell, you deserve to feel good. So, give yourself the love and care you deserve and you'll start feeling that way. It worked for me.}}}

I was in a deep suicidal depression16 years ago and the medication was able to pull me to the rim of hell so I could cope with what I had to do next and that was to heal myself. Depression occurs when you have unresolved or unexpressed emotions trapped in your subconscious that is wanting to come out and we try our best to push them down which in turns creates sadness, aches and pains, uncontrollable crying and all the symptoms with depression. It also goes along with low self esteem and self loathing. It is also when we allow our thoughts to control us instead of controlling them. I get upset when I read comments like , just take a hot shower or go for a walk all of that is a load of c&%p. This is how I cured the depression I lived with for 20 years and now I have been depression free for 11 years ...begin by journaling all the good in your life because you are just focusing on the bad Gratitude is key and the 1st step. Write down 5 things daily that you are grateful for. Than begin to build your self esteem by affirmations of I am and I deserve...examples I am Smart, I am confident and so on..the I deserves would be I deserve to be happy, I deserve to be loved or whatever it is for you that you are not having in your life it is most likely because you do not feel you deserve it and believe you can have it. Do that daily for as long as it takes. Next pick up a book by John Gray called How to Get What You Want and Want What You Have this book saved my life. Learn how to properly process your emotions do the healing letters to every single person that has ever hurt you in your life. What it ultimatly boils down to is forgiving those people that hurt you. I had to go back and forgive my step father for molesting me, my mother for not protecting me and all the abuse she put me through. I had to forgive my high school counslor for shattering my dreams that day when she told me that being a police officer was not a realistic future for me. I spent 1 year 3 times a week writing healing letters to every person that ever hurt me at that age I was 29 and had a lot of luggage to let go of...after about 3 weeks of doing this I began to feel alive again and changed my life. It is not just saying I forgive you you do have to feel some pain to be able to get rid of it. You will process the emotions that got trapped when that event in your life occured and you will be freed of the pain and hurt. The memory will always be there but it will not longer have a hold on you and hurt you no longer. There are other ways something called EFT you can youtube it also called tapping that has helped me with recent stuff also something called RIM which I am a facilitator for and that is a faster process than healing letters. If you just start with the 1st 2 things you will begin to turn around and you could heal your past along the way. I hope this helped this is what I did in my life and I have taught to people which has also changed their lives! good luck and love yourself you deserve it!!!!p.s. at the time I began this process, which I call the Life Empowerment Process, I was not only suffering from depression but anxiety I was not driving, vertigo, OCD and was diagnosed with Miniers disease and Dr.s said I would be like that forever. Within those 1st 3 weeks all that began to fade away!! That was 11 years ago no more of any of it! WHOOHOOO!! it is possible for everyone~}}}

Everything is going to be allright!It's all in your headSnap out of itDrugs are dangerous/a cop-out/only for people with "real" mental problemsGuilt.And the fact is, the best you can hope for is to develop an understanding of the physical and mental dynamics of your depression. Long term solutions are going to require using this perspective to make significant change. And yes, this part is hard. Relationships, spirituality, self-confidence -- these things take years.}}}

Once it's stopped you, it is very difficult to move forward or anywhere really, because inertia takes over.  You feel stuck and it seems a daunting task to find anything in life that motivates or brings you joy.  Anxiety is common when facing depression.  The fear that you cannot keep up with life's demands and responsibilities is scary. The anxiety just gets worse cause you feel helpless to fix the situation and so sink into worry, doubt, insecurity and isolation.It starts to pile up and soon the light dims and your soul sinks....Do Not Allow this Nightmare to become your Life!!!No matter how heavy and dead inside you feel....throw yourself up and out of your mind's imagined limitations and force yourself to put one foot in front of the other and walk outside.  Just keep walking...go somewhere quiet with nature.  Be with mother earth.  She has not and will never allow you to fall.  She supports you and holds you and loves you as a part of herself.  Once you can exist in nature, you will exist again in your nature and reclaim your identity.  You will know yourself again and you will feel grounded in that knowing.  You will remember your abilities...your strengths...passions....dreams and desires.  You will want them again and you will be fully able to live them again.  As your confidence grows, the anxiety fades because you do not allow worry.  Before anything can cause you fear, face it and take care of it so it is over and done with....and out of the way.You can take it from here....Easy!!!}}}

Once you get it out a few times, you might find the real thing to be a little easier.Your brain has evidently developed a habit of freezing up when in a situation it determines is highly uncomfortable.

What I do want to add is that is not a good idea to self-diagnose on the basis of symptom lists. Back when I was in psychopathology-class, I had to memorize the DSM-IV front to back. You wouldn't believe how much of all the symptoms listed in there applied to me and my classmates. It really freaked me out sometimes.Of course, we didn't have all those disorders, and that is why you should really leave psychological assessments up to experienced professionals who are trained in how to interpret and apply your specific circumstances to a standardized list of symptoms; it's way harder than it looks.}}}

I believe he was trying to tell me how he felt about me but nothing came out and he got very nervous. It all happened so quick that I didn't know what was going on. I felt horrible for not being more alert to his feelings.  It may have been easier for him to ask me how I felt about him. That way I could have started the conversation first and maybe put him more at ease. This way he could have also found out if I liked him before disclosing his own feelings. In general when men get upset they get angry- women cry.

It's pretty common and it sounds like in your case isn't extreme so it should be fairly easy to get over. The main thing you need to do is repeatedly and deliberately expose yourself to the situations that effect you this way but not before you prepare yourself with a few tools. For talking to girls ...Think about the way you have made chitchat with other people and especially strangers without even thinking about it. Memorize those kinds of topics so that you have something ready to say in any situation. It doesn't have to be witty or anything - just talk about movies, music, your surroundings, even the weather. Just give yourself the ability to speak.Accept that on the first several tries you will probably seem shy or awkward and maybe even stutter or say something embarrassing. The best thing to do if that happens is to laugh at yourself and keep smiling. Say something like "God, I don't know why I'm stuttering so much." or "That made more sense when I said it in my head." An laugh, allowing her to laugh too, and keeping things more relaxed. Remember that it's ok to be weird or awkward sometimes. Everybody experiences it from time to time and they understand.Practice puppet posture which is imagining yourself as a puppet with three strings. One is at the back and top of your head pulling up. One at your tailbone pulling down. One at your breastbone pulling up. Relax your shoulders. You should feel it in your abs and not arch your back. Don't strain. The strings pull gently. This combined with as much eye contact as you can manage while still feeling natural will make you look and most importantly feel much more confident.Don't give up. It may take a lot of time to get over but if you keep doing the above, especially the part about deliberately exposing yourself to these things, you absolutely will get over it. As for expressing your anger, you can take a much different approach. Don't avoid the things and people that piss you off but you still want to do things like walk away to cool off when you get overwhelmed. Once you have cooled off for a few hours or even a day you can think about the best way to articulate how you're feeling. You can write these things down and give it to the person making you angry or try talking to them. Try to observe if they themselves are fully cooled off yet before you do so. Ask them to stay silent until you're done talking and promise to do the same for them when you're done. Let them go first if they insist. If they interrupt just say "please let me finish". If they still won't shut up then say "okay I guess we can try this again later." And walk away again. Like the shyness thing, the more you do this kind of thing the easier it will get. Confrontations are hard for everyone but the calmer you can be, the calmer they can be and conflict resolution will happen more quickly. Be ready to compromise and try to put yourself in their shoes. This doesn't mean that they are right, only that you want more peace in your life and are willing to do what you have to do to get it.Conflict resolution is complicated so this stuff may or may not work for you and maybe the people pissing you off aren't close enough to you to warrant this kind of detailed approach but that's what I've got for you. Good luck.}}}

I credit you for acknowledging your anxiety and wanting to do something about it. Some people struggle with anxiety a long time before coming to terms with their challenge.My first suggestion is devising a game plan.Understanding more about your anxiety will give you a better idea how to address it. What are the symptoms you experience? What are circumstances that the symptoms present themselves? How do they go away? By creating more awareness to patterns and circumstances of your anxiety, it will be easier to devise a plan to address anxiety. It would help to keep a journal of days events. Even on days you don't experience symptoms this is helpful information to know.Overall, lifestyle is something to take a look at. Diet, exercise, alcohol intake, employment, and support groups should be evaluated. These areas could have significant impact on anxiety symptoms. Also, recognize thoughts that may contribute to anxiety. Anxiety is a signal from our brain we are reacting to. Often times this signal is a subjective interpretation of events or situations. Even if anxiety is not directly related to our thoughts, your response to anxiety symptoms could influence the intensity of anxiety and duration symptoms last.Lastly, if symptoms do not go away, consider talking to a professional.

I'd rather stay away from councilors altogether at this point.1 Comment Loading... }}},{{{I'll try to break down the confusing mess this question.I believe your gripping dread from simple mistakes, to be due with you having to low self esteem. Not that you hate yourself, but that you don't think of yourself in a positive light. It might be so, that you put yourself down around others. Our self esteem comes from the perceptions that others have of ourselves and how they treat us, so it can be hard for me to find out exactly where that is coming from, as I don't know about your life.I'll now give you two possible reasons for why you have self esteem, which could be wrong. It could be because the good you do goes unnoticed, while your mistakes have you condemned; or because you're not accepted by your peers for the opinions and viewpoints that you have. It can be hard to find out where our low self esteem is coming from, as seemingly trivial things that happen to us over time, chip away at us, without us knowing it at the time.About thinking about your future, I say that you should live your life with no regrets, so you can avert yourself from further disappointment later on, looking at your actions in a positive light. I believe in the uncertainty of life, that the more uncertain your life is, the more interesting and happier it is; as life being unpredictable, provides you with opportunities. What I can say, is that you should become an opportunist, if you are not one already. Being a drifter who inwardly thinks too much, can only get people so far.About you doing voluntary work, that just depends on your outlook at life. Some people like to do selfless things like charity work, and some people like to do front facing things such as get famous. It appears to be that you do both, with your volunteer work, and your writing. Doing both things alone, are not enough to make someone happy, which is what I've learnt. For someone to be truly happy in life, they need to be given regard for who they are as a person, and what they do. To be more specific, to be happy after a specific time period, you would need to of had something worthwhile happen in the past in that time period, and something you can take with you into the future from that time period. Not everyone is privileged enough to live a good enough life to have that, which is why you should be an opportunist, if you are not one. Some people say "Life every day like it is your last." That is true. But we also can't do the things we wish to do on certain days. So this is why I say "Don't put off for tomorrow, what you can do today." And I try to apply this rule to everything, even though I know I won't attempt everything.We're all human, and we all seek regard from others in life. This is normal. When people don't have regard and feel marginalised, they can sink into a self deprecating downward spiral of depression. Depression is something that we get, when we don't feel that we have any control over our own lives. Any little thing can make us depressed, such as loneliness or losing a job, as long as we feel that we can't exercise control over our own lives. This is why people get anorexia, because they want to regain their control. This is another reason for why it's a good reason to be an opportunist.Also as human beings, we all want to make our mark on the world, modifying the world of which we experience. I'm typing words into a computer screen to influence you, hundreds of miles away. You answer questions on Quora to influence others. Paris Hilton just introduced a new signature shoe line for sale at South Coast Plaza, to influence others, as her fame is advertently declining. The difference between Paris Hilton and you, is that she can be happy without her shoe line, because she has a sense of gratitude for her memories with people, and accomplishments for the future.I can see why counselling doesn't help you. Counselling is for people who aren't self aware, to help them identify their problematic thought patterns and behaviour that they are oblivious to, to help them develop a better approach to dealing with other people. Not everyone is self aware, and not everyone is intelligent, so it's good for me to remind you (and me), of that.I don't know what much I can say about rape, depression, and BDD; because right now I am only scratching the surface, and I can't really deal with your past, if I don't know you as a person.The problem with CBT, is that although it's good for changing someone's perception on the world and thought patterns, it doesn't really work for people who think and see things better than the counsellor or the majority. Don't quote me on that, because I don't really know, but it's a feint opinion. I could be wrong about that.There's lots more things whizzing round in my head that could give you advice on how to help you, but I'm not going to put them in this answer, as it is long enough as it is. I can only say so much in one answer.What I want to know, is why you read books about postmodernism and existentialism. I just don't get it. Why do you do that? Me personally, I do not understand people who want to learn about everything and anything. I think that people should only learn about, the things that they have a use for. Keeping three books on you at all times, isn't going to help you gain a better perspective on life, or have a cheerful disposition on life. Learning for the sake of learning is a bad thing to do. I don't understand people who like the act of learning. It seems like you read depressing stuff.I've got a contradictory saying that I've made up that you might like. It might make you happier.Everything in life has no point, except eating, breathing and sleeping; but influence or reclusive composure is the point.The more you think about it, the more it makes sense. Try thinking that way all next week starting from Monday, and see what happens. I will not tell you what that phrase means, especially reclusive composure, until next week is over.By the way, this question reminds me of me - a lot!Not for Reproduction}}}

Just so you know -- you're not alone. Everybody has those moments (unless they're Totally Normal, but who is?).1. For the irrational self-consciousness of social errors, short term: during the initial rush of panic, pretend nothing out of the ordinary happened (hopefully you can pretend). Breathe. Keep walking. Then remind yourself that nobody noticed because they are busy with their own experience. Also, if any one noticed, they a) probably have done something like that before, so their reaction is compassion or amusement, not derision (if they do, that's their problem), or b) they were bored and you provided a bit of entertainment.Long term: ask yourself, "who am I?" Find out. Be exactly who you are, always. If you're not, try. This is your life. Volunteer every now and then, give to others. Spend time with your peers. Listen to and take care of your body.2. For the trying to do everything, short term: usually the manic feeling isn't very productive. What are your two or three year goals? I find that to be a thinkable amount of time to plan actual things that you will do. Try not to set unreachable goals (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sel...). Education and experience are good investments, always. Don't amass too much debt.Here's what I call the One-Step-Forward Cycle I go through: 1) Control everything2) Start feeling anxious because you can't control everything or it's overwhelming and there's so much to do3) Give up in the face of crushing world-on-shoulders feeling4) Hide/escape/do nothing5) Get bored and start doing something6) Build confidence because you managed to do one thing. Do another thing. Then another, and another, and the universe is controllable! you can do it! and7) back to 1).It is ultimately constructive.3. Really, the biggest thing: love yourself. Be comfortable in your own skin. Deal with your past because it made you who you are today. The future... you can't really control it completely, but you can control your own behavior and make better decisions. You've already started by asking this question. Ask the people in your life (old ones, young ones) questions. Find out how you like to have fun. Learn stuff. Experience stuff. Be.}}}

I know this sounds dumb and basic (because it is) but exercise has helped me tremendously with anxiety. It takes up mental real estate normally used for worrying. It bumps your endorphins and gives you a  nice buzz. You sleep better when you've been extra active and you look better in the mirror which improves your self image. I was nearing (probably passing) obesity. Had a heart attack at 34 followed by open heart surgery. A slightly healthier diet and 30 minutes of vigorous exercise a day have changed my whole life including some of the psychological hangups that led me to an unhealthy lifestyle. I swear it helps... Dont say you dont have time to work out... that is my excuse about twice a week and it always leads me back to a lower spot than I would have been at if I had gone for a 10 minute jog. Dont think of it as anything other than a type of medication. Just try it for two weeks and see what a huge difference it will make in how you see yourself and the world around you.}}}

Below are few things I have to say:1) Stop  visiting Counselors. The thought of visiting them or actually visiting  them makes you feel more sick.You are perfectly fine.2) Dont bother  about what others think about you. I know its very easy to say and hard  to follow but let me tell you you will gradually feel the difference as  you carry forth this attitude in you. 3) Dont think too much about  your future. You dont know whats in store for you tomorrow. So no point  worrying about it. Also cultivate this habit of doing things which  interests you more which will invariably get rid of such thoughts in the  long run.4) Continue to do your volunteering. Never do anything  expecting any results out of it. Do it you if you enjoy doing it and do  it for your own satisfaction. If it reaches people in need then its just  a bonus for you. Always remember "What goes around Comes Around"... 5) This book is a good read:http://www.amazon.com/Feel-Fear-...}}}

EPILEPSY.Now add black out and convulsions as an alternative to the above runaway cascade.  The blackout shuts off the panic cascade thereby conserving glucose and the convulsions PUMP lactic acid out of the skeletal muscles.  Veins have non return valves along them so that by the convulsions stretching and contracting them they act as a series of pumps to speed up the delivery of lactic acid back to the liver.Brain tumors don't directly trigger seizures.  They use a lot of glucose the more malignant they become (what's called the Warburg effect)and so exacerbate (make worse) the cerebral hypoglycemia}}}

In the midst of the cloud or fog of a panic attack, your friend's mind is focused on herself exclusively. She is almost nonthinking and just reacting to what is in her head. You are hardly present in her mind except for your role as 'helper' until her panic subsides and she returns to being her usual self, the person with whom you initially chose to be friends.By her telling you to 'man up' (and, by the way, I detest the sexism of the language she used, but we have to deal with facts as they are) I believe what she is saying (via the context you described in additional information to the question) is that she would like you to help her calm down. Panic attacks are frightening, and the physical symptoms reveal this as sweat, fear, agitation, increased heart rate, etc.I agree that she should see a therapist, but that is not what the question you asked requests. The question is, what can you do or how can you improve what you are doing as you relate to her during her panic attacks. And I have a few suggestions for you, as follows:Look her in the eye. Touch her shoulder or hand or arm if she isn't too agitated (touch can be a reminder of a time when we were infants, and our parents touched us for physical support and hopefully provided ample human comfort). But touch is tricky and you might want to ask her about that some time when she is NOT having a panic attack. But when she is, Tell her you are right here. Say "I'm right here. That was then. This is now."Ask her "What specifically are you thinking about and what triggered your fear?"Listen.By defining the present you are helping her to leave the flashback. By explaining when you ask, she is using a different part of her brain than the one paralyzed by fear. By explaining, she is releasing the daemons inside. By explaining, she is moving from fear to analysis. By explaining, she is trusting that talking will help her. By explaining, she accesses her brain, the fog lifts, and she forms words which do not have the same power over her (the source of language comes from the analytical rather than emotional/fight or flight part). You are trying to get her to switch brain functioning and use distraction to make it happen. Your 'manning up' (so sorry to use that horrible expression) will be in keeping her talking until she is well past the apex of her panic.At some point when she is calm but doesn't realize it herself, point out that she looks like she's feeling better, and ask "Are you feeling better now?" and smile warmly at her to show you care.That is how I would like to see you as a friend, supporting your friend who is having a panic attack. She will feel valued and cared for, and you will be showing her that you know how to support her as a friend.I would also suggest that you mention that telling you to 'man up' is insulting, because even though someone may be mentally ill and experiencing delusional and frightening thoughts, it does not mean that you must accept her words or actions without protest. Let her know how you feel, too. That's what friendship is all about!}}}

Your friend needs professional help (if she wants to function better outside her home, that is), and that's not your job.I think it's interesting that your friend, who knows better than anyone that we can't always control our feelings by sheer force of will, demands that you do so, and in a demeaning way. You may want to look at your motivations for being in this relationship. What do you get out of it? Is it worth your time? Maybe I've said too much. If so, I beg your pardon, and please disregard my unsolicited advice.I have experience with agorophobia and panic disorder. In my (unqualified, non-medical) opinion, your friend's best bet for treating agorophobia is desensitization therapy. Regarding panic, you can't really do anything in the short term, except "be there" for your friend. The panic will subside on its own, in its own time. You can't really do anything to hurry that along. Sit with her, hold her hand, tell her everything will be all right. If she asks if she's going to die, say "no." All obvious, no special techniques necessary. Accept that you will make mistakes and act anyway. You already know what to do, there's no shortcut, no preliminaries.You and/or your friend might find some benefit from Constructive Living, which teaches us to accept our feelings (since we can't change them directly) and to focus our attention instead on doing what needs to be done at the moment (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Con...).}}}

What I needed was just someone there holding my hand and making me feel safe until I could stop crying and start breathing normally again.I'm going to break with what's already been said and say that it's not unfairly demanding for the agoraphobic person in question to ask that you "man up." You say that she normally can't get more than a few hundred meters away from her home, but she can go a few kilometers with you. You are taking her farther away than she is comfortable alone. In doing that, you are inherently promising that she's safer with you. If you can't comfort her, don't encourage her to go father from home with you than she would without you. (Alternatively, only take her to a therapist.) In this instance, "man up" means "don't freeze up", which is a reasonable request.Anonymous gives great advice on how to comfort your friend during her panic attack. Verbal and/or physical reassurance that she's safe is what she needs. Sit with her. Hold her hand. If you don't know what exactly it is that she wants to hear, just say, "It's okay."}}}

But you can help her, in my case it works, hold her hand hard, it works as a distraction and make us feel that we're not alone. While you are doing this, speak to her, tell her that Everything's OK and tell her to breathe properly, and if it's possible do it with her, like the women in labor do, but slowly.Maybe this would help her to make shorter the attack and make you feel useful.Sorry if my English isn't good, and I hope you get what I'm trying to say. Good luck :)}}}

(I say this as a person who has had panic attacks in the past.) She's quiet abusive in putting this "man up" thing on you. That's kind of sick (I guess we know that she is sick) - but this is not healthy for you. She's not getting what she wants from you so she undermines your sense of your own masculinity? I don't think that is OK. I don't mean she needs to be left alone with this. But she's the one who is in charge of dealing with her mental illness. Impugning your manhood is no part of dealing with her own crap. It is her therapist's job to get her through this.  You perhaps need to back way up and decide what you can and wish to offer and what is for she and her therapist to work on. A set of ears and a cup of Kava Tea is great for anxiety. Don't propose solutions. Don't try to fix anything. It's her work to fix it.}}}

The other people answering the question are right in that she definitely shouldn't be asking for your help in such a derogatory way. It seems by even asking this question that you have at least somewhat internalized her request as a shortcoming of your own. Don't.If I know how people act when it comes to their insecurities, and I do, I can tell you personally that people don't act rationally. They don't make sense. But they still talk. And as a genuinely helpful person, you are probably listening in earnest to what she is saying to look for ways in which to fix her problem. Focusing entirely on this, you might forget to judge the sincerity and incentives behind her words. Again, Don't.When we feel insecure, we don't particularly like to shoulder responsibility for the problems that make us insecure. It's easy to put the blame on others. And I don't know about you, but if I had agoraphobia, I'd sure as hell be insecure about it. It looks as you took to Quora to dissect the meaning of her request for you to "man up." Dude, Don't. The bottom line is that she's probably projecting a mess of shoddily communicated feelings on to you that will only misdirect and confuse if you try and read too much into semantics. Stop looking to yourself to solve HER problem. It's probably unnerving you and causing you to panic and freeze up.This isn't your first rodeo. It's not as if you don't know how to respond. You have a good sense of how to deal with any panicked situation if you've dealt with epilepsy before. Don't listen to what she thinks you should do because, in this case, she really doesn't know what's best for her.Follow you own judgment, and you'll be 1000x more effectual in actually helping your friend.Side Note:I'm really surprised nobody has even alluded to this, but since the way your question read makes the situation between you two seem platonic, I thought this would be worth mentioning. If you are close friends, and she's telling you to "man up," it could be that she has some feelings for you she doesn't feel comfortable explicitly expressing. And in case you happen to be a sexually oblivious rhino, you might want to do a little reflection on the relationship between you two so far to look for hints that she might have dropped. But thats a whole 'nother can-o-worms.}}}

She really needs to get help from somebody who is certified to help people suffering from agoraphobia.It's just too much to ask from you to make her feel well - unfair if you ask me. Even if you are good friends. So, of course you shut down not knowing what to say, because it's probably hard for you to really thoroughly understand what she's going through. I mean, what do you say if there isn't anything to be fearful about? It's quite different from helping a friend who suffers from something concrete as epilepsy. You might not know exactly what it feels like to have seizures, but it's clear what's going on and what you can do to help her. Not so with agoraphobia.The second part - your fear - poses a real problem for you here. But from the information given I can't really make up where that fear comes from. Your friend might be so intimidating that your response is considered normal. Or your friend's behavior might trigger some learned behavior with you because it resembles something you might have picked up in the past and are subconsciously still fearful off. It might also be you highly value your relationship and are so afraid of wrecking it by saying something stupid, which would be understandable. In other words, we need more information to be able to help you.}}}

They are real, and they are difficult to deal with, even with professional help. You might want to do some research so you can get a realistic idea of what your friend is actually asking you to do - and whether it is possible for you to do it. There might be support groups in your area, or perhaps a visit to a therapist who specializes in these fields is in order. I must say, I do not like what you describe about her approach. In fact, I got angry when I read it. The requirement to "man up" is aggressive and, as Ernie points out, demeaning. This "friend" is apparently trying to manipulate you into taking responsibility for something that is entirely her responsibility by getting angry ("frustrated" is anger in a smaller package) and belittling you - suggesting that you are somehow less of a man -  if you don't. Yuck. You say she is one of your closest friends, though, so I guess you are wanting to hang in there with her.Your response to her panic attacks sounds not only normal to me, but instructive. Of course you are afraid. See the paragraph above. And perhaps, in a quiet moment, check inside to see if there isn't some part of you that is also angry at this most unreasonable demand/setup for failure.EDIT: So, like some others who answered this question, I have been downvoted for not directly and thoroughly answering the question. I will quote John Morrow: "EDIT:  Apparently this was too subtle for someone so I'll "improve" the answer by spelling out the obviously implied point that if you want to help your friend, you should encourage her to seek the help described above. Sheesh." And I will add this: You can also help your friend by not taking on something that is her responsibility. This is not good for you or her, and could even make things worse by reinforcing her reluctance to take control of her own mental health issues. Sheesh.}}}

I am a stuntsman and one of my tricks is to be locked in a coffin and the coffin will be buried 4 feet under the ground. I had to fight my way out of it in an hour. The first time this happened, I was buried underneath half feet of soil and was told to practice breathing for atleast 15 mins. It started well, thanks to my yoga pranayama practice, and I was there in a dark little box where I did not have place to move my limbs freely. It was like I am falling down in an infinite abyss and it just won't stop. I was prepared for this moment and promised to be strong but then I started experiencing slight halucinations, because of which I could not sync my breathing pattern as planned. I started banging the door out of despair but in vain as I asked my colleagues not to help me. I reached a situation where I was desperately looking for air to fill my lungs with and thats when the situation got worse. An opening formed at a corner and sand started to fall in. Luckily, the situation got a lot better in the next few seconds as the opening was due to my colleagues opening the door. They were worried when I stopped banging the door. Finally when the lid opened, there was a blinding light I couldn't tolerate. My eyes shut down almost instantaneously and I took a heavy intake of air through my nostrils and a fully open mouth... To be honest I can not express my experience in words. The closest expression of those feelings, according to me, were in the movie Life of Pi. I could totally relate myself to the scene when Pi fights back to his life. You see random unexplicable hallucinations when you somehow survive to reach the promised land.}}}

Why do any of us voluntarily consume alcohol, which is after all - a drug?Many people drink alcohol, that does not make them alcoholic. The good effects of alcohol are that it can make us feel more 'socially included', it can make us less inhibited, it is fun to drink with friends.The reason alcohol does this is that it is a 'relaxant' and it is, in limited quantities, a stimulant.The downside of this is that alcohol, in large quantities, is a depressant. In order to achieve 'hangover' status, large quantities of alcohol are consumed. It may well be that the amount of alcohol consumed is affecting 'mood' and that merely reducing the amount consumed, can lead to a reduction of these distressing symptoms.Additionally, alcohol intoxication and withdrawal  can lead to other symptoms, these may be some of the symptoms that you perceive to be related to the hangover:-loss of sensation in the arms or legsloss of muscle powerprofound memory disturbancesa shrunken brain.(www.net doctor.co.uk)Alcohol is associated with an increased risk of suicidal feelings, this is not just found in patients who are 'alcoholic' but in other social drinkers as well.Anecdotally, in our Emergency Department, it is clear that some of our patients who attempt suicide or self-harm, do so because they are under the influence of alcohol. Again, this may correlate to a certain extent with your own symptoms.My advice would be, if you are worried about your drinking overall, seek face to face advice. However, if you are merely an occasional and social drinker, you may find that these symptoms can be reduced by drinking less and avoiding binge drinking.}}}

I do not get this when I don't drink other than when I am very dehydrated or have had a lot of caffeine. }}},{{{I am answering this question both for you as well as for those who might be alcohol dependent.  No judgement is implied, I just believe in giving a comprehensive answer that a spectrum of people can benefit from.  My answer contains some theoretical leaps since so much is unknown about the pathology of alcoholism, but you will find enough support to see that I am not purely speculating.Anxiety is a known symptom of alcohol withdrawal and is best treated by avoiding alcohol consumption and thereby avoiding withdrawal.  Understanding the possible causes of this condition can help you perhaps mitigate it while continuing to enjoy alcohol on a recreational basis, but quitting cold turkey may result in even more severe symptoms (seizures, DT's, and death) if you are currently alcohol dependent.  If you believe that you cannot manage your withdrawal symptoms please get to a physician since alcohol withdrawal can be life threatening.In animal studies there is a growing body of evidence that points to dynamic changes in GABAa benzodiazepine receptor plasticity and subunit conformation as it relates to alcohol withdrawal, either after acute administration or in a chronic intermittent withdrawal paradigm.  The result of these studies points to an increase of alpha4 containing subunits of the GABAa receptor and decrease of alpha1 containing subunits.  Clinically this switch is recognized in humans as benzodiazepine insensitivity in chronic alcoholics, but acute benzodiazepine insensitivity is also possible acutely after binge drinking, or after a very long time of intermittent drinking.  The alpha1 subunit is sensitive to modulation by benzodiazepines (xanax, librium, etc...) whereas the alpha4 subunit is considered less "sticky" as a binding site for these drugs.  Clinicians will give alcoholics in withdrawal doses of librium that would knock a normal, benzodiazepine sensitive individual on their ass.An increase of alpha4 subunits of the GABAa receptor is correlated with an increase risk for seizures as well as a marked increase in anxiety.  It is rapidly induced in vitro as well as animal studies through acute administration of alcohol followed by withdrawal.  In the initial tests, the receptors tend to snap back on their own, but chronic intermittent withdrawal results in a gradual shift towards more alpha4 containing subunits and less alpha1 containing subunits.  In other words constant drinking and withdrawal can lead to a situation where the brain does not "snap" back as easily.  Interestingly enough this switch seems to be mediated by neurosteroids and is also identified as potentially being related to pre-menstrual and post-partum anxiety.Now to get back to your question which is what you can do about the anxiety you suffer the morning after you drink:If you are not a chronic drinker then try to take some time off from drinking to let your brain snap back if possible.  However if you feel your anxiety increasing then please get to a physician because alcohol withdrawal can be life threatening.  If you are a chronic drinker then visit a physician and tell him that you want to undergo a "detox" protocol to abstain from alcohol.If you do continue to drink then try to consume less alcohol and over less time.  In the in vitro and animal studies the change in receptor subunit conformation takes approximately 48 hours of acute alcohol administration on a naive system (never had alcohol before).  I will take a leap here and suggest to you that the human equivalent is either extensive binge drinking, or continuous daily drinking.  Take breaks and lower your intake.  Do not drag out your dose of alcohol and allow your brain to marinade for too long.  It may be that moderating your drinking to a certain level will reduce the morning after anxiety you experience.  We often drink way too much, not because we need it, but because it feels like the right thing to do.  Put more thought into how much you drink.Look at other medications that you are taking that might compound the effects of alcohol on this neurosteroid mediated pathway on your brain.  These include oral contraception (if you are female), anti-anxiety medication, benzodiazepines, prescription sleep medication, nicotine, and other drugs that impact the brain (legal or illegal).  Try to think of what you are exposing your brain to and you may come to realize that you may be medicating an underlying condition using several different agents including alcohol.  On the other hand you may realize that you were feeling better before you combined several substances or medications.  Please discuss your thoughts with a physician- psychiatrists know quite a bit about both anxiety and alcohol and many of them are credentialed to deal with alcohol and drug dependencies.Look into trying to normalize your receptor subunit conformation by doing research into compounds such as miltirone that have been shown to inhibit the upregulation of alpha4 subunits in alcohol withdrawal in rats.  I only mention this compound since it comes from a rather innocuous plant (salvia miltiorrhiza) that has been used traditionally in traditional chinese medicine for centuries.  The identical compound (chemically) has also been isolated in Rosemary and is referred to as rosmariquinone. I am not condoning any form of risky experimentation or treatment- just sharing what I have found.}}}

You're not alone in this and it can get better. There are a lot of different potential causes to panic attacks. You should try to see a doctor and a counselor to rule out any physical causes.There were two aspects to my panic attacks. First, there were triggers. These were incidents that started the mental processes of the panic attack. They could be as innocuous as wearing a shirt of the wrong fabric or a stressful encounter.Second was what I called the circle, the spiral of thoughts and feelings that fed on itself until my emotional state couldn't handle it and I had to find a place to break down.There are two sets of tactics you can use. You can eliminate triggers by removing their emotional power over you. You can identify and break the circle.Don't hide from your triggers long term. However, if people or an organization trigger you, take a break from contact with them for a while. Journaling helps to identify and name triggers, and it often exposes them and helps remove their potency. Once settled I tried to 'kill' my triggers one by one. I left my church, I started working on standing up to bullying co-workers so that these things lost their potency to trigger meIf you're in a circle already, name it for what it is. Say "I'm circling right now" out loud to yourself. Write down your thoughts one by one in a circle on a piece of paper. This will force you to slow down your thought processes. It will also give you a list of things to talk to your counselor about.Pick a anchor point. I had a rope bracelet I would hold and rub between my fingers. I chose it and named it as my anchor and used it as a mental focus to 'send' the panic (I visualized this as green fog) into the bracelet and into the ground. Pets are a good anchor point too. It's not 'real' but it's a very effective way to visualize yourself as taking control.Use a mantra. I used the Litany Against Fear from Dune."I must not fear.Fear is the mind-killer.Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.I will face my fear.I will permit it to pass over me and through me.And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.Where the fear has gone there will be nothing......Only I will remain."Yes, very geeky. But it helped.Start a consistent exercise program with heavy, compound lifts,I recommend StrongLifts or Starting Strength. These are simple exercise programs without  complicated calculations. They will wear you out and give you a focus point.Work on your sleep habits and your eating habits. Anecdotally a probiotic and a B-complex and D vitamin supplements helped me settle my emotions.}}}

If you took a photo of just the passenger area, you would never know the car was in an accident. But it was completely totaled. It was a terrifying experience that made me screaming and swearing pissed off, especially since the only reason I could get out of the car was because I am so thin since the doors would only open a tiny bit. Since that accident, I have had minor panic attacks whenever I have had to get on the freeway, rush hour or not, even if I'm not driving. I'm saying they are minor because I don't pass out, but they feel horrifying to me, driving me to the point of tears or hyperventilation at times. Sometimes I have no choice but to take the freeway, so I have had to try to overcome this irrational (to me) reaction. It's gotten a little easier over time, it's been about 5 years, but it does take time and an understanding of why I react this way. To me, my panic is irrational. So I practice deep breathing and forcibly relax myself whenever I need to confront the issue. Try to recognize your triggers and work slowly to overcome the issue. If you feel you are overreacting, you can start to work on it. There is no quick fix and it is a big deal to you regardless of what others may think or say. So tiny, tiny steps may help you to eventually overcome. :)}}}

Every time I make it through a rough spot and manage to keep my head, I feel less weak.  Think of each source of stress as a wall that's keeping you from being happy, then break them down.  They do build up and get tougher over time, so it's more like maintenance.  And be realistic with yourself.  You may be dealing with this for a long time, but you will manage, and it will get easier.  I'm one of the worst cases my psychiatrist has ever seen, and he was amazed I had managed on my own so long.  It can be done alone, but don't be afraid to ask for help and understanding.  You deserve that.  Hang in there.}}}

My Grandmother, Mom and sister are all on anti-anxiety meds and while I do not look down on them at all for that, I didn't want to go that route unless I absolutely had to.Very unfortunately, my attacks were instantly linked with food. The first time I had one, I had been eating something and I thought I was having an allergic reaction. I have had severe allergies all my life, but not to food, in an anaphylactic shock way. In an instant I was sure I was going to die. We went to the ER, but by the time they saw me, I was fine. Doctor checked me over, found nothing, sent me home. Because anxiety runs in my family, I almost instantly had an inkling that this had been a panic attack and not an allergic reaction.My regular physician agreed with me, but had me tested for allergies for the first time since I was a child. The takeaway was that I was less allergic to things than ever before. Really, only dogs and cats. Great. I "knew" that it wasn't allergies, but I was still getting panic attacks over food. And I was at risk of them becoming more generalized. I went home with the Epi-pen, and thought about what happens during an attack.First, when I get an attack, I hold my breath. My neck tenses (so I feel like it's tightening.) My heart starts to race to make up for the lack of oxygen.Okay, then. The first thing I do now - is breathe.For some reason, if I think, "Oh no, what if I eat these nuts and I go into shock?" (Forget that I'm not allergic to any nuts, this is not my rational mind speaking.) I clamp my mouth shut and start breathing slowly and deeply through my nose. I take 5 breaths like this. If there is (and so far there has not been) any sign of change for the worse, I look at my wife and say, "How do I look?" She looks for any signs of blue around the lips, checks my eyes and says, "You look perfectly fine." And I am. When the panic attacks got bad for a while, I would have to do this several times during a meal. I just kept breathing and slowly, slowly, have trained my body out of the pattern it was developing when I started to eat.As I write this, I can't think of when my last attack was, maybe about a year ago. I have no idea if it will work for you, but it most definitely worked for me.}}}

That said, I'm sharing my own experience with anxiety medication because it's what worked for me personally.----If you read any part of this post, read the bolded section below. It's important for me express what I think is the #1 most important thing to know about clinical anxiety and panic disorder:IT'S NOT ACTUALLY IN YOUR HEAD. Well, not anymore. Even though Anxiety and Panic Disorder are classified as "mental illnesses," the term is misleading, as the true culprit of any sort of clinical anxiety disorder is your parasympathetic nervous system. People with slight-to-moderate anxiety can cope or even be cured through talk therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy -- as your brain can certainly affect your nervous system's behavior to an extent -- but what you perceive as cowardice, mental weakness, etc. is actually malfunction on the part of your nervous system that your brain no longer has control over. Sure, it might have been caused by years of anxious thinking -- but the same way anxiety can give someone an ulcer or aggravate heart disease, it can also just mess up your nervous system.And just like an ulcer or heart or any other body part that isn't functioning the way it should, your nervous system might need medication to act normal on a day-to-day basis -- which has the fantastic side effect of preventing anxiety.I'm not saying that everyone needs medication. But for those of us that do, it can be a revelation to realize that moderate-to-severe anxiety is actually a physical disorder rather than just an inability to get your head straight or to keep your emotions in check. It takes a huge burden off you when you realize that a messed up parasympathetic nervous system is not something that you could necessarily think or talk or deep-breathe your way out of, if only you were smarter, less weak, less emotional, etc. etc. etc.So you're told that you may be on medication the rest of your life? Well, join the club. Millions of other people take medication til the day they die cause their organs aren't as awesome-sauce as they could be, whether it's their heart, their lungs, their liver. Your nervous system is just another organ. There's no point focusing on your status as a "mental patient" or any sort of patient, really, because half of Americans take prescription medication.----More about how anxiety mucks up your nervous system, from http://www.panicla.com/:When the brain perceives a threat or danger, messages are sent to a section of your nerves called the autonomic nervous system (ANS) which then activates the adrenal glands in the kidneys to secrete chemicals, such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, which key up the body for fight or flight. The autonomic nervous system is divided into two sub-sections called the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is the actual system that releases energy and prepares the body for action. The body then typically restores itself back to normal after a period of time by the parasympathetic nervous system, which acts as a kind of stabilizer.For people who are prone to anxiety and panic attacks, their parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), or their ability to restore their body back to normal after experiencing a stressor, does not seem to function properly. Hence, people who suffer from anxiety and panic attacks have a faulty parasympathetic nervous system, which for some unknown reason mal-functions in its ability to restore the body back to a normal state. The sufferer then remains keyed up simply because there are high levels of free-floating adrenaline in the body that have not burned off yet. For some it lasts for hours, for others it can last for days.}}}

Refer to Diane Meriwether's graphic image if you like, or else picture The Board seated around a huge conference table in the conference room of your mind. It is the decision making body of your corporate world.Next, imagine that you have two Board Members, Anxiety and Panic. They will have their say, and if you follow the logic that Diane sets out, you will see that they will always have their say.BUT -- you won't be leaving them alone in the Conference Room. You are a smart Director of the Members of the Board, and you will always make sure Anxiety and Panic each has at least another Board Member seated beside each of them, ready to counter their motions to the Corporate Body.The most reliable two Board Members seated beside them are Logic and Awareness. You will use these two Board members vigorously. But they are not the only ones present.With each motion made by Anxiety and Panic, you will have Logic and Awareness speaking to the rest of the Board Members.Be sure there are other Members at the Conference table at all times. If you are too inebriated, exhausted, sad, unexercized, sick, overworked, or overwhelmed to have other Members present, well... the loud voices of two obnoxious Board Members will rule the corporate body by outshouting Logic, who is more soft-spoken, and Awareness, who listens to everyone and then expresses her/himself. So it's important that other Board Members who have various attributes helpful to the decisionmaking processes of the Corporate Body be present in enough numbers and with enough vigor to counter unwanted messages (which will always be emanating from these minority positions).Let me give you an example: a woman in my first year law section was a two pack a day smoker. Due to the stresses of law school, she was increasingly anxious and panicked, and increased her smoking to three packs a day. I gave her the Board of Directors metaphor and suggested she quit smoking by using that as her imagery. She imagined one Board Member as an inveterate smoker who was a true addict. That Board Member kept waiting for everyone to leave the Board Room so that Smoker could light up. So long as the rest of the Members made sure one stronger Member was present with Smoker, they could control Smoker's actions (not urges, but actions).This law student did want to quit smoking, and the metaphor worked! She employed it and regularly held Board Meetings at first many times daily, where the Smoker told everyone how great cigarettes were, how much that Smoker wanted one, etc. By letting the Smoker vent feelings about addiction and desire, this law student was able to admit her feelings, and decide with Logic and Awareness that each urge is met with a choice. She became a nonsmoker. She quit completely. With decreased nicotine addiction, her anxiety and panic became more manageable. She was present for more law school work, and absent less often on smoking breaks.How you proceed is up to you, the Members of your Board, and your imagination -- I wish you the very best!}}}

(Roll the edges a bit and then put it over your nose and mouth.) The crumpling/uncrumpling of paper will sound insanely loud to you, and you'll be breathing very fast, and you'll be sure you're going to smother, but what it *actually* does is regulate the ratio of CO2 to O2 in your bloodstream, so you will  eventually relax (and you won't get dizzy/nauseated from over-oxygenating). It would take me anywhere from 1-10 minutes. Paper bags are porous - you won't smother. Also, start taking high quality omega-3. It's not harmful (you have oil dressing on salads all the time) and it makes your endocrinological system work much better if that's what you are needing (and is completely harmless if not). I use the liquid kind that comes out of the bottle and is kept in the refrigerator.}}}

The last one was about 5 years ago. For me it is usually about thinking myself into an untenable box and not attending to what I really need and want in life. Your mileage may vary of course, and your triggers may be very different. I take them as a sign for the need for DEEP reassessment of goals and beliefs in my case. One thing that I have found super helpful is (Not a paid product endorsement) - is Yogi Tea - Kava Kava Tea - to stop that adrenaline over reaction in it's tracks.  I carry them around just in case.  Kava is hard on the liver so do not use this constantly.In any case do not think of this as something that will never go away. You can actively manage it and you can learn a lot of very useful relaxation and breathing techniques. I would also highly recommend a yoga practice. There's nothing wrong with taking meds if this is a constant problem for you. But there are many things to try before that. Lots of excercise, yoga and this tea would all be things to try with consistency before getting on expensive, dependency inducing meds. This has worked for me. Also... applying this rule. Are you a good friend to yourself? Meaning do you give yourself the same compassion you give to the people you love in the way you think about your own life and choices? Something to contemplate...All my best.(I am not a doctor - just a fellow person with anxiety.)}}}

She taught her patients methods to deal with their constant pain while going through chemotherapy. This is what I learned from her for dealing with panic attacks in the moment, and over time, they have almost completely dissolved. It's important to sit down or lie down, close your eyes and imagine a quiet space.Begin to count backwards from 1000. The thing is, this can be incredibly difficult in a panic situation. It is easy to become distracted. To prevent this, there are three things that are important to do. With each number take a breath and let it out. Visualize the numbers the way you would visualize sheep, and most importantly, instead of looking at 984 for example and saying "nine hundred and eighty four" say "nine eight four." I takes more concentration and therefore is more of a distraction from your attack.If your attack takes over for a minute and you lose your place, it is important to start the process over again from 1000. It's exhausting to start over, and exhaustion is good. You're trying to mentally wear yourself out.I've done this for years and it has always worked for me. I have also found, the more frequently you use this method, the less time it takes to come down from an attack. When I began, it would take me about 200, sometimes 300 numbers to calm down. Over time, I got it down to about 50.}}}

Secondly, you gotta learn how to control it, starting by assuming that it will end, that the anxiety will be going up until some point and then, it will be over, so just  let it be and let it end. When it reaches the top/limit, the anxiety will decrees. Anxiety can give you a really hard time but it can't kill you. You need to work on self control by understanding what you are having, breathing and knowing that its a normal process that so many people has, don't scare thinking that what you are having its uncommon. Many people suffers anxiety, just every person`s`body express its in a different way.}}}

For breathing, breathe slowly in your nose for a count of 5 seconds.  Then release the breathe out of your nose for 5 seconds.  Repeat this measured breathing to keep yourself from panicking and drawing sharp breaths that will speed your heart rate.Practicing mind/body techniques, such as yoga, meditation and pilates can be extremely helpful as well for reducing overall anxiety and living a more calm day-to-day life. Seeing a therapist can also be extremely helpful in these instances as well, but for some people this is not an option.  Another great thing to do is find a mantra that you find soothing that you can repeat to yourself when you are feeling anxious.  For example, doing a breathing technique and repeating something like, "This too shall pass," slowly, can help you focus on something positive to get yourself through this moment of mounting anxiety.  Your mantra can be anything that you find soothing, so pick a phrase that is comforting/special to you.}}}

I found that after going to a psychologist it wasn't very helpful, two things got me over anxiety and once you can do these two things you will be rid of those horrible experiences. The first thing you need to do is understand how anxiety works a way more in depth look into the cycle I explained above one that breaks down the entire attack up to the neurons in your brain and thought process. This will help you to recognize what's happening to you while it's happening and you will gain the control to turn it off. The second thing you have to do is stop focusing on negative things and start focusing on the positive in your life, an easy way to start changing your thoughts from negative to positive is to keep a gratitude journal in which everyday you record 3-5 things that you are grateful for in your life. This next thing is not essential but was definitely helpful was positive affirmations an example could be something like "I have a sound mind and I have control over my thoughts". I hope this was helpful, you really will get over your anxiety attacks if you consciously make the effort to do so.}}}

Because they were NOT told what  sort of reaction they would experience, they felt they couldn't trust  the department sending them and they all, or most, pulled out their  commissions.  Okay, in this situation there is no possibility of  auto-suggestion as they were NOT told beforehand that they might have  panic attacks.  I guess that with the attack coming right of the blue  this is analogous to someone having an attack out in the suburbs but  that would depend on the situation.  The researchers would know that  there had to be a connection with the injection, whereas someone driving  a car in heavy traffic, pulled up at a red light, on a centre lane so  unable to pull into the kerb, a police car behind, thinking they've been  given a drug like LSD, terrified of losing their mind and going  berserk, would be different.  In this situation there are all of the  elements of a runaway CASCADE which I'll deal with later in “A Model for  Schizophrenia”.THE ROLE OF NORADRENALIN IN THE WILD.Noradrenalin, like adrenalin, is referred to as a 'fight or flight'  hormone.  I disagree and I'll explain why.  Let's imagine a deer grazing  on the African Savannah.  A lion suddenly appears and the deer is  frightened and takes off.  A flood of adrenalin is released from its  adrenal glands and from different parts of it's brain.  Adrenal  constricts or narrows all of the blood vessels to it's gastrointestinal  tract including pancreas, gall bladder, and kidneys, i.e.  everything associated with digestion and assimilation.  It's been  grazing so all of its energy stores, fat in fat cells and glycogen in  muscle cells and liver cells have been topped up so digestion and  assimilation can stop.  I might defecate as well to offload unnecessary  weight.  Meanwhile all of it's blood vessels to it's heart, brain, lungs  and skeletal muscles, i.e. everything necessary for 'fight or flight  are DILATED or opened up to allow MORE blood to flow to these organs.   Adrenalin also increases the metabolic rate of these organs so they burn  energy at a faster rate.  Adrenalin also acts on the liver to stimulate  it to break down glycogen to glucose and release it into the  bloodstream for fuel as well as stimulate fat cells to release fatty  acids and glycerol (glycerine) into the bloodstream as a source of fuel.   When the blood glucose level in a relaxed animal falls, the hormone  GLUCAGON is released by the ALPHA cells of the pancreas and it act's on  the liver to release glucose  as will as having a mild stimulatory  effect on the heart only.Suddenly our deer spots another lion coming toward it from the opposite  direction as the first so it rushes off to one side, yet another lion,  swivels around to rush off in the opposite direction only to confront  yet another.  It has been ambushed, no escape.  It rushes all over the  place becoming increasingly terrified and confused as it does.  The more  frightened it becomes the more confused.  Every way it rushes the worse  it's situation becomes.  It stops dead in it's tracks and freezes,  becomes totally immobilised in a state of terror.  Ironically, this is  the best state that it can be in, given it's situation, as it is LEAST  VISIBLE, not moving.  Hawk's vision can spot movement from a a great  height but is no good when it's prey freezes and is well camouflaged.  Enter NORADRENALIN, the hormone of being frozen stiff with fear and NOT  'fight or flight' as noradrenalin CONSTRICTS all of the blood vessels  that adrenalin dilates and has NO METABOLIC EFFECT on skeletal muscles,  the very opposite to that needed for 'fight or flight'.  These changes  CONSERVE enery.  It also alters perception to what we would call  sinister, increases sensitivity to sound, all changes essential to  'fight or flight'.  These perceptual changes may also result from the  formation of a range of LSD like hallucinogenic neurotransmitters in the  bloodstream and liver, e.g. adrenochrome and orthomethyldopa.  More on  this later.NORADRENALIN IN THE CONCRETE WILD>Ok, but no lions are present, no tangible threats whatsoever trigger  most panic attacks, so why a release of noradrenalin in this situation?   Here the threat is INTERNAL, not external.  It is life threatening  cerebral hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar in the brain) due to a  malfunctioning liver having run out of glycogen and having an impaired  ability to make it from lactic acid coming from the skeletal muscles,  thereby triggering the release of adrenalin, noradrenalin and cortisol,  the subject of tomorrows post “A Model of Schizophrenia”.  Incidentally  there is only one difference between a panic attack sufferer and a  schizophrenic and that is a diagnosis applying a label and the very  negative consequences of that label as well as the antipsychotic drug  that goes with it. 					    					     					Read more:  Panic Attacks Forum - Panic attacks caused by refined sugar.

I had not engaged in any social media until the ripe old age of 42, and I went on with my real name.   I'd noticed here, over time, how all of a sudden, I had stressed about my perceptions from an answer read, stressed about a conversation, stressed about how I was presenting myself - both in image and text, so many things that we stress about sometimes in human interaction. It took me a while to remember that this is a natural reaction to good writing that you are being exposed to.  I say "cracked myself up" because this is just social media. It is NOT the same as a face-to-face interaction.  For the vast majority of interactions I've had here, I've never met these people and probably never will. So why such stress??Post by Kate Simmons on AmbienceThe conversation I've had with myself about this issue had often gone like so:- These people are like psychological stereotypes to me  (via social experience and "programming") and yet they actually are real people with lives of their own.  Who am I to judge them;  and more importantly, anyone here who is worth their salt will know the same about me.  If they don't, and they frequently won't (as in real life) the heck with them. We all deserve better. Don't ever be afraid to be yourself, here or ANYWHERE. Even if you occasionally facepalm, we've all done it ;-)- The personalities here are so myriad and complex, it's a joy, at least to me. I have that x-step-removed bit to comfort me and others I interact with here that it's just a social media conversation.  I have learned so much here!  I think most participants would classify it as a gift of education and positive global interaction. That's got to be the most worthwhile focus: the benefit of learning.- As to why I've chosen to stay and to participate, I hope I have knowledge that people have found useful and helpful, as I imagine most answerers here hope.  We're all people here together.  Why not share your knowledge?  Why not, indeed?The amount of people who may benefit from or enjoy your answer far outweigh any repercussion, both real or imagined. Take the chance - share! - We have all, as people, shared the same, same, same experiences, challenges, milestones, insights - until, of course, it proves different!  It really all should be carried further into public domain.  I believe in supporting this vision.  You never know, until someone communicates back to you, whether your answer is helpful or not.  You just have to trust in your good will in putting your experience and knowledge out there that someone will make good use in carrying it forward.  Such is the way of things, if you believe in the public domain of knowledge. SO, why not share?  You have knowledge to share - so go for it!  The key, at least for me, has been in answering the question to the best of my ability, and then Leaving It. It's an exercise in journal writing that you're willing to share with others: you get the cartharsis of writing about your knowledge and experience - probably becoming clearer in your mind/heart about the topic/ issue in the process - and also sharing your knowledge and experience with other "seekers" in the process.   Don't be afraid to own it.  The process must be because it's valuable to YOU in the expression itself.}}}

Any tips or advices how to get through college would be great }}},{{{Melissa provided such helpful tips for this answer so I don't have too much more to add, but here are some things that I did to help overcome some of my anxiety in college when trying to study:Don't cram: You may think that you're being productive by studying in the morning to late at night, but you're not actually retaining all of that information. It helps if you break up your study time so that it isn't such a marathon and you don't tire yourself out by the end of it.Take little breaks + Reward yourself: It's important to make sure you're studying or doing your work for hours of the time, but make sure to take some time for yourself too. I used to hate knowing that I'd be wasting my weekends away on just studying so I decided to break it up by studying in the morning until lunch and then running an errand or taking an afternoon nap. Then I would start up again and make plans to catch up with friends over dinner. It made me feel like I was accomplishing more with my day and having a healthy balance. Eat three meals: You may think you may not need to, but eating re-energizes you and will keep your mind and body refreshed and ready to take on the next task.Ask for help: I used to think that I was just bad at taking tests, but when I was in college, I was finding that it was even more difficult to keep my focus during exams. I became sensitive to sound and every time someone sighed heavily over a problem or tapped their pencil on the desk, I would become distracted. Whenever someone even finished a test and left the room, my eyes would immediately dart to the door and I would wonder why I wasn't close to finishing yet. When I realized this, I decided to reach out to my university's learning center where I discovered how test taking would bring on anxiety for me. From that point on, if I ever felt a little bit more nervous about an upcoming test, I was allowed to take my test outside of the classroom away from my peers in a room at the learning center completely by myself. It made a significant difference as I started to feel more at ease and received better marks.}}}

Any tips or advices how to get through college would be great }}},{{{Here are some of the tricks that have helped me in college:Study for exams ahead of time: There's nothing worse for your ADHD/anxiety than leaving studying until the night before the test and not being well prepared. Go to the library: It's hard to study in your dorm room or in noisy places because you'll be easily distracted. At the library everyone is quiet and studying and that will help you do the same.Take notes: This will help you pay attention during class and remember what the important points were later.SelfControl: When you're doing work on the computer, it's easy to get distracted by social networking sites. To help yourself avoid wasting time, use SelfControl to help you temporarily block websites like Facebook, Twitter, Quora, reddit, Pinterest and any other sites you might waste time on.Go to the gym: It will clear your mind, reduce your stress, and help you focus after the workout.Get enough sleep: Sleep deprivation will make it even more difficult to focus the next day.Eat well: A healthy breakfast will help you focus right away in the morning. Avoiding sugars will help you avoid energy crashes.Positive reassurance: Don't freak yourself out before every test. In the end, it's not that important. I can't seem to get this one right—no matter how much I've prepared, I always get super nervous before tests, even though I've never had one that actually went badly.Take your meds: This will help reduce the impact of the ADHD/anxiety during the day and helps level the playing field so you can do just as well on a test or in class as anyone else. If you're used to taking meds most days, then forgetting them will really be a problem and you'll notice the difference....Even on weekends: Even if I'm not doing work over the weekend, I still don't want to be spacy (from ADD) in social situations with my friends.Keep a tasks list: Sometimes I get stressed when I have a ton of little things to do and it's hard to keep up with all of them. Keep a list on your phone/paper/whatever to remind you of what you need to do, and check them off as you go. This will also motivate you to actually complete the tasks.Set small, incremental goals: Sometimes it's hard for me to focus on a large project that isn't due for a while. Set small goals for yourself to stay on track and keep yourself motivated....And larger motivating goals: Reminding myself of my larger dreams and goals, and picturing myself there, keeps me on track and motivated to work to get myself there.}}}

Meta-analyses consistently show that CBT treatments involving some combination of exposure, applied relaxation, social skills training, and cognitive restructuring techniques are efficacious for social phobia. Across meta-analyses, CBT for social phobia shows moderate to large effect sizes at post-treatment in comparison to wait-list controls (Rodebaugh et al., 2004). It also shows moderate to large within-group effect sizes from pre- to post-treatment. Treatment gains appear to hold or modestly improve at follow-up assessment (Feske & Chambless, 1995; Chambless & Hope, 1996). No significant differences in efficacy have been consistently found between individual and group CBT formats (Fedoroff & Taylor, 2001; Gould et al., 1997; Taylor, 1996).Primary source: The treatment of social anxiety disorder}}}

A few years ago, however, my problems became severe due to a lot of changes taking place in my life that I was not equipped to deal with, and that is when I decided to see my doctor.He first put me on some tablets, which I soon stopped taking because I could not bare the side effects. Then he recommended I should try group CBT sessions, which I attended diligently for 10 weeks. The changes were slow but steady, and looking back a few years on, I now really appreciate the effects of these therapies.I am really passionate about this subject, so much so I have started a website to help others who are suffering like I did. CBT can be a real life saver, even though for socially anxious people the biggest step to take is to acknowledge the problem, and face our fears head on.}}}

What I do want to add is that is not a good idea to self-diagnose on the basis of symptom lists. Back when I was in psychopathology-class, I had to memorize the DSM-IV front to back. You wouldn't believe how much of all the symptoms listed in there applied to me and my classmates. It really freaked me out sometimes.Of course, we didn't have all those disorders, and that is why you should really leave psychological assessments up to experienced professionals who are trained in how to interpret and apply your specific circumstances to a standardized list of symptoms; it's way harder than it looks.}}}

It's pretty common and it sounds like in your case isn't extreme so it should be fairly easy to get over. The main thing you need to do is repeatedly and deliberately expose yourself to the situations that effect you this way but not before you prepare yourself with a few tools. For talking to girls ...Think about the way you have made chitchat with other people and especially strangers without even thinking about it. Memorize those kinds of topics so that you have something ready to say in any situation. It doesn't have to be witty or anything - just talk about movies, music, your surroundings, even the weather. Just give yourself the ability to speak.Accept that on the first several tries you will probably seem shy or awkward and maybe even stutter or say something embarrassing. The best thing to do if that happens is to laugh at yourself and keep smiling. Say something like "God, I don't know why I'm stuttering so much." or "That made more sense when I said it in my head." An laugh, allowing her to laugh too, and keeping things more relaxed. Remember that it's ok to be weird or awkward sometimes. Everybody experiences it from time to time and they understand.Practice puppet posture which is imagining yourself as a puppet with three strings. One is at the back and top of your head pulling up. One at your tailbone pulling down. One at your breastbone pulling up. Relax your shoulders. You should feel it in your abs and not arch your back. Don't strain. The strings pull gently. This combined with as much eye contact as you can manage while still feeling natural will make you look and most importantly feel much more confident.Don't give up. It may take a lot of time to get over but if you keep doing the above, especially the part about deliberately exposing yourself to these things, you absolutely will get over it. As for expressing your anger, you can take a much different approach. Don't avoid the things and people that piss you off but you still want to do things like walk away to cool off when you get overwhelmed. Once you have cooled off for a few hours or even a day you can think about the best way to articulate how you're feeling. You can write these things down and give it to the person making you angry or try talking to them. Try to observe if they themselves are fully cooled off yet before you do so. Ask them to stay silent until you're done talking and promise to do the same for them when you're done. Let them go first if they insist. If they interrupt just say "please let me finish". If they still won't shut up then say "okay I guess we can try this again later." And walk away again. Like the shyness thing, the more you do this kind of thing the easier it will get. Confrontations are hard for everyone but the calmer you can be, the calmer they can be and conflict resolution will happen more quickly. Be ready to compromise and try to put yourself in their shoes. This doesn't mean that they are right, only that you want more peace in your life and are willing to do what you have to do to get it.Conflict resolution is complicated so this stuff may or may not work for you and maybe the people pissing you off aren't close enough to you to warrant this kind of detailed approach but that's what I've got for you. Good luck.}}}

Both my girlfriend and I tried everything we could to make them feel at ease and to bring them out of their shells, but after speaking to their mother, found out they were just naturally introverted.My closed-end questions were met with with curt, one-word answers.  My open-ended questions received not much more of a response.  As we were driving around town, I could see them through the rear-view mirror just gazing out of the window, appearing very disinterested in conversation.  They failed to ask me a single question about myself during the entire duration of their two-month stay.I found their behavior and manners rude, disrespectful, lacking and offputting, particularly toward someone who was trying to be a hospitable host.I realize this may be an extreme example of what you are trying to describe, but my advice would be to make an effort at conversation.  You don't have to be a chatterbox, but be friendly, respond to questions with more than short bursts of information, use body language that shows others you are receptive to conversation, share some information about yourself and ask questions to show that you are interested in what is being said.If you sit there like a bump on a log just staring off into space, there is a very good chance people will interpret this behavior as being rude.}}}

After all in Proverbs it says a wise person is slow to speak. I think we are almost conditioned in the West to be on the go all the time so we come to expect that people will generally will be talkative.  If you are not naturally talkative I don't think that's a bad thing at all. I do think however if you are holding things back and not talking then that is a concern because you increase your odds of exploding in an emotional outburst. I would find it rude if I asked you a question and you ignored me, I would likely find that behavior not flattering. Generally though I expect some people to be naturally quiet and silence is natural to them. A wise person told me that some of the more quiet people in life are some of the most interesting since it goes to the quote "Still waters run deep" meaning that quiet people often are thinking about the deeper matters of life.Overall silence isn't a bad thing and it would behoove many of us to enjoy it like those great poets Depeche Mode told us}}}

That's true of a marriage, but it's also true of me buying something at the corner store. We say or do something, and then we look to see how the other person took it. We want them to take it well.When you stay silent, you break the rhythm of their normal conversational exchanges. You force them to start guessing about how you are reacting.Imagine that you send me an email. Let's say you're applying for a job you really want. You check for a reply 3 minutes later, just because you can't help but look. Nothing. So you wait a day. Still nothing. You wonder if you did something wrong. Nope, the letter still looks good. Another day goes by with no answer. Did it get caught in the spam filter? Oh shit, maybe I don't even know you want the job. But sending another note right away will look crazy, so you wait. Another day passes. Still nothing. Is it something about you? Do I hate you for some reason? Another day passes. My god, it is probably about you. You resume's not perfect for this position. You thought you at least merited a polite reply, but maybe you're not even that good. Maybe you deserve only contempt. And then another day passes. Sure, that's a little crazy. But people are a little crazy. That's what you get when you let monkeys run a planet.Silence is so discomfiting that it is used as a negotiating tactic.If you take advanced sales or negotiation training, you'll learn that silence is a powerful tactic. For example: Using the Negotiation Tactic of Silence. In our culture, silence is often a sign you've done something wrong. You can fluster a lot of people just by giving no reaction. They might give you a better deal, or reveal something about their position.And let's not forget that the silent treatment is a punishment. As is solitary confinement.So just say or do something positive.Since silence is a negative response, try small, quiet responses. A smile and a nod. The thumb-to-index-finger ok gesture. A thumbs up. Short, information-free answers: Nice. Cool. Thanks. Good. Yes. Ok. Great. Fab. Right. Neat. Yup. Those are almost like silence in terms of informational exchange. But you are acknowledging and validating your conversational partners. That will let you honor your quiet nature without making them feel like jerks.}}}

I am quiet myself among people unfamiliar to me, and my son is even more quiet.  Much the opposite among friends, but quiet a lot of the time.  So my perspective is from that side.     I think that when people are talking with you, it's a pretty reliable sign that they find you at least reasonably interesting (perhaps more), and that they like you at least a little, or at the very least don't dislike you.  And most people like to be liked; almost everyone, in fact.  If you are silent, people don't have solid reason (at least to them) to believe that you are disinterested in them.  All they know with a certainty is that you find silence preferable at that moment to communicating with them, and  it just has to make them wonder why.  "He prefers absolutely no communication preferable to communicatioin with me."  And it just gives a lot of folks the jitters.  "What did I ever do to him?  I don't even know him."   With a certain numbers of years has come the realization that too many people take it the wrong way if I am completely silent, so I now fall back on a few topics that are of broad interest, and I offer a few observations or, much better, ask them a few questions regarding these things.  This doesn't mean I become loquacious or (is logorrheic a word? :-)  ), but I find it eases tension a little bit, and it's pretty effortless to ask a few questions.  And,  it lets them talk, which is probably what they really wanted in the first place.}}}

The same reason you don't kill your neighbor for hosting a party on a Friday night when all you want to do is sleep, at the same time being silent is generally perceived as rude.It is not as much a cultural or geographically-centered question, but more on the lines of interpersonal behavior and introvert/extrovert relationship (as in communication).This talk from Ted: Page on WwwIs pretty good at explaining the wildly different behavior and one of the reasons why sometimes one part feels like the quiet person is being rude, while it may be simply lost in introspection. I for one am more along the lines of silence and quietness than being the center of the party.So, to recap, I would make an effort to avoid curt and simple answers, as they indeed cut people off from any sort of meaningful connection; it can be hard, especially for an introvert, and especially since most of the times the conversation we overhear are of the most banal type, hardly worth engaging to. On the other hand, not making an effort is cutting you off from the chance of something interesting happening; you don't have to do small talk and exchange meaningless pleasantries...maybe you can guide the conversation to topics of your own interest (without being monopolistic and/or bore to tears the other person!).}}}

No, seriously.We need information to survive; this is a deep-rooted, fundamental, evolutionary trait. We rely heavily on our "tribe" for information--and today, "tribe" is a bit confused, so we often treat strangers as tribe-members (though not as family). So when someone is silent, we feel like we're not getting information from them, and we've evolved to be very uncomfortable with that, because back in the day it meant that this person was not friendly and might eat you. Or mug you.Let's break it down.We need information to survive. We pull information in from the world constantly, consciously and  unconsciously; then we process it; and then we draw conclusions about  what to think, do or say. If you were walking at night in a dark jungle,  but you had your noise-cancelling headphones on, and you decided to  wear sunglasses because, hey, it looks cool: how likely are you to get  eaten by the resident tiger? An extreme example, but you get the idea.We rely on each other for information. Tribes, man. That's where it's at. Once upon a time, tribes had space from each other. But within the tribe, people relied heavily on each other for support and information. There's a wild elephant on the rampage? Shout about it, spread the word! (No Twitter back then, alas.) Now, we're all smushed up thanks to a larger population and more knowledge of the world and the global economy and the Beatles. (Just kidding about the Beatles.) So we're a giant tribe! And that means we instinctively rely on each other for certain things.Now, you might say, "But in cities we all ignore each other! We pretend we don't see each other." That's true, but if someone gets hurt, many people run to help. If you notice that something is wrong, you don't keep it to yourself--instinctively, you shout about it. That's all part of our deep-seated "united we stand" tribe mentality.If someone is silent, you feel like information is being withheld. What is she thinking? Is he feeling uncomfortable? Should I say acknowledge him? Is she going to mug me? Does he think I'm going to mug him? Is she mad at me? Aaaaaa! So many questions--and no obvious answer. If the person just talked, you'd feel so much better because you'd know what was going on!Not everyone feels this way, or so strongly, but this is the underlying worry we have when we're with someone who isn't talking.So over time--and I mean millenia--people have evolved socially to communicate explicitly with each other in order to show that they care, that they come in peace, that they are part of your tribe, that they are trustworthy. That's why we struggle when a loved one is not talking to us. That's why we feel happy when we hear a loved one's voice. Dilute that so we're talking about strangers, rather than loved ones, and we still have that instinct.FAQWhat if I'm an introvert? Or shy? Or just quiet? Those are three separate things. Sometimes, you can get by without talking much if you smile at the other person, just to signal that you're friendly. Sometimes, you can say at the outset, "Just so you know, I tend to be quiet, but I'm listening." Sometimes you're just feeling withdrawn and/or grumpy and there's nothing you can do. It's okay. Over time, you'll build your own inner circle of people who understand and accept you.What if someone thinks I'm rude because I'm not talking? Or snobbish? Again, if you can indicate with your body language that you're engaged and interested, great. If not, then you just have to suck it up. I've been there, and it's frustrateing when people think you're aloof, when really you're just feeling uncertain or shy or... just quiet. And again, over time, you'll build a community of people who understand you.What if I think someone is being rude because they're not talking? "Not talking" is different from "signalling rudeness." Look at the body language. Is the person basically relaxed? If he is tense, is it "I'm nervous" tension or "I'm on a secret mission to destroy" tension or "god I hate you" tension? Don't jump to conclusions. Smile at the person and say hi. He might respond. He might not, if he's really uncertain or scared--or just from a culture that tends not to talk to strangers. The person could also just be really socially awkward. Like, really.There are a million possibilities, and it's (again) an evolutionary trait that we jump to the worst possible conclusion, that the person hates us or is going to harm us. And we do that so that we can protect ourselves against the worst possible outcome. 99% of the time, the worst doesn't happen. So relax. If someone isn't talking, smile, say hi, and move on.}}}

Participate in activities such as Toastmasters.  You'll soon realize the power of expressing yourself through words, and how much value it brings to your social life.

They understand language and all its complexities. Nobody helps us to go beyond language, to go beyond words, to reach the wordless space within us.The society is against it, because if you can hear silence you will not be a part of the crowd mind, of the collective mind. You will become an individual immediately.And an individual is a danger to the state, to the establishment, to the society.Silence is the explosion of intelligence. Silence means: inside you, you are just spaciousness, uncluttered spaciousness. Silence means you have put aside the whole furniture of the mind—the thoughts, the desires, the memories, the fantasies, the dreams, you have all pushed aside. You are just looking into existence directly, immediately. You are in contact with existence without anything in between you and existence. That is silence.Silence can be profane too. Silence can be sacred too. Silence has as many nuances, as many dimensions as your being has. It is multidimensional, and it is tremendously pregnant.Silence has its own tremendous force, its own power.The moment you understand it, all fear disappears. And the society exists through exploiting your fear; hence, it teaches you from the school to the university, it devotes almost one-third of your life in learning words, language, logic. It is not concerned at all that you should understand silence.To understand words and to hear words is very simple. Anybody can do it; just a little education about language is needed, nothing much. But a tremendous transformation is needed to hear silence and to understand silence…. @http://www.goodreads.com/book/sh...}}}

Being a quiet person myself, I have received many complaints from friends about my silence. Sometimes they say that I am not listening, or I should react differently to some news (by talking more, preferably), while I just smile or take a little pause in the conversation. These pauses or silences usually get translated into me being distant or not caring, but it is usually the opposite, I really do care. I think this happens because they are not able to appreciate the serenity of quietness. In general people are scared of what other people think or feel about anything; hence, they prefer talking and sharing over silence without realizing that sometimes silence is more expressive than the actual talking. Also, silence makes some people uncomfortable because they need to constantly know what the other person is thinking.For me silence kills the noise in conversations, and it should be appreciated more. I know only a few people that can appreciate quietness, and the moment I  can have a comfortable silence with someone, I feel understood and happy.}}}

In the example put up here, there is a valid point that the guests were introverts and hosts wanted to engage in conversation, so the guests should possibly, follow the social norm and continue the conversations, but when there is no social situation and people try to drag you into conversations you find off putting but the majority of the society around finds interesting, I think it should be considered as a favor to the minority that the majority should accommodate their silence.Yes silence is definitely rude when you are expected to answer but you choose not to. For example, you are minister in India, and you remain silent over a request filled under Right to Information Act, that is rude very very rude but at the same time if some press fellow asks the minister which sports team you support at home or what did your kid wear on a particular event according to me it is perfectly normal to stay silent. But it turns out that people in power are almost always extroverts, without any concession for minority rights of introverts, they find it ok to stay silent on official matters and speak volumes about unofficial matter which excite emotions in crowd. That, according to me is rude. very very rude}}}

You'll spend more time thinking about doing something and talking about doing something than actually doing something.

Ex girlfriends have have told me I lie around the 85th percentile, but in no way do I always consider myself the best looking person in the room at all times.Starting off sometime in late high school, I realized I got more attention than other guys. Interestingly enough, not only from women, but peers and teachers as well. This led to a sense of entitlement in which I believed I didn't have to work to get people's attention. Alas, I was wrong.Enter college. Suddenly in a much bigger pool, where I was one of the youngest of the thousands of males, I was as forgettable as the lessons on how to reject alcohol at a party. It might have only been because I needed more time to develop, but I became fully aware of having lost my sense of uniqueness. As one of my exes described, my bubble had popped.I had gone from behaving as a distinctly social animal to an introverted recluse. Headphones and marijuana had replaced parties and booze. It took a few months until it kicked in, but I became paranoid of people around me and felt fragile every time someone put their eyes on me. Could they possibly view me as average?It's worth noting that I didn't fell unattractive. I was simply scared of being considered normal. My brain could not cope with the possibility that I didn't stand out to everyone I met. In a sense, anxiety can be a manifestation of thinking that anything other than perfection is failure.Another point worth noting is that I sought acceptance by sleeping around. Between ages 19 and 20 I had been with about 80 women. I was the male version of the easy girl with no self esteem.I wasn't ready to deal with all of my issues in college. I took antidepressants starting sophomore year, and they did a hell of a job. I lowered the doses slowly, as I matured as a man and learned how to behave socially and acknowledge my place on the world. I went on to be elected president of a club with around 700 members, 400 of whom were present for the speeches. I was also able to walk around campus without having my heart pound as if every person I passed by was aiming a gun at me.I wouldn't say I've met my goal yet, as I'm 23 and still on 75mg weekly of sertraline, but it sure beats the 75mg daily I started out with. I moved to NYC and got a great job that involves constant social interaction, but every now and then I still feel like I don't belong. Overall however, I feel much happier in this world than I did in my high school bubble. And I would give up every single one of my ~100 former hookups to stay with my current long term girlfriend.It's true what they say. It really does get better.}}}

Not to say community support isn't helpful, but we're a bunch of strangers. How much can we impact your life right now?I'd first think why you're on medication, and what you'd have to change about your mindset that will allow you to get off medication. Your nervous system is irreparably damaged? Who told you that? Yourself? I might not be professionally trained, but I know stress and the symptoms of stress. You are incredibly stressed. But the good news is, stress comes from within. You are going to have to change something fundamental about how you think and feel. Block the outside world. Find inner peace. The importance of a degree is debatable. Some of the highest achievers on the planet are high school dropouts. You know why? Because they are committed to lifelong self-education. Screw your degree. Your wellbeing comes first. I'm not saying give up, but have a hard think.What do you really want to achieve in life, and why is a degree the only route? It isn't. You've been conditioned to believe that, along with the push to join the rat race. Wake the hell up! Your potential is infinite. A piece of paper is useless. It is the process of learning and developing that is important.This is not the end of your life! You will learn a tremendous amount about yourself and others and the ability for the human spirit to overcome seemingly impossible odds, because you will overcome this. But you cannot fix this with the same mindset that got you here.}}}

The secret? Developing a perspective on my perspective. I now have a stable view transcendent to my unstable one, so I can account and compensate for the warping of strange base perspective.How? A lot of really intense self-exploration, not allowing me to hide from myself no matter how it sucked to look at myself. Now, I've rearranged and I love myself.In fact, I have motivations to go back to school.Actually, I want to go back so that I can get a societal permission slip to go to work reinventing the educational system.Final answer: Focus on you for now.

I have also been bullied , made of fun of and shown down again and again .Moreover the girl whom I used to like also insulted me on the basis of my poor financial condition , it broke me and hurt me so deeply that I went into depression . My studies started suffering ,grades went poor , and I could not complete the project which was so important for me to progress in life , and this aggravated my unhappiness . I started suffering from low self esteem and a haunting sense of low self worth . All this made me feel crippled .But let me assure you that nothing in life is permanent , pain cannot persist for an infinite amount of time , it has to go . It may take time to heal completely but you will not have to suffer forever . Good news is that I have started overcoming this depression and have improved a lot .Things that helped me :-1) Running - I keep running every now and then . Don't think about the results , just run because it is a valuable activity . If you will wish for the results then it will make you unhappy .2)Reading Motivation Quotes - Gave me some healthy food for thought.3)Surrounding myself with real friends - I could express my unhappiness in front of them and they always understood me and helped me forget my pain .4)Laughing - I used to think of unhappy moments of my past and laugh at them , thinking how silly and unimportant those misery causing events were . Make those moments seem small and unimportant , the more weightage you will give them , the more unhappiness they will cause .5)Doing things that helped me add new skills - I started learning coding . It thrilled me !These are a few of things that helped me overcome my unhappiness .Always remember that the main cause of unhappiness is our attachment to people and objects . The moment we will get detached we will experience what Godly Love is , what divine compassion is , what it means to forgive and most importantly what it means to live .Why weepest thou ? Celebrate your life , it is still a lot better than any beggar who doesn't even have shelter to live under and food to eat . Aren't you blessed ?Be brave !

That stuttering was made substantially worse when speaking to a woman, especially if I found her attractive. Because of my embarrassment I shook nervously, trailed off and damn near broke into tears in long conversations with people I didn't know. Strangely this was only around people my age.  I knew this wasn't going to be a viable course moving forward so I came at the issue sideways.What was the core problem? I can't speak well, especially to women. So, it would make sense to first learn to speak more better (!) and then apply those lessons in learning to speak to women.I am one of those crazy bastards who jumps into the deep end of the pool only after freaking out about it for twenty minutes. So, I thought about it for close to a month and then started acting. Auditions in local theater, getting involved in the school's drama club, learning monologues in the mirror at home, watching Shakespearean actors enunciate the hell out of their lines. I wallowed in all of these things. Immersion therapy FTW!I sacrificed a lot to achieve my goal of becoming a better orator, all in service of the greater goal of getting laid. Ah, the joys of puberty.I had stage fright so I performed rehearsals in my underwear until I got past it. I couldn't speak well so I auditioned for the roles that demanded the most of me. I couldn't speak to women well so I wrote notes asking women to speak to me and, if they didn't mind, to be patient. This was a step I took only after having been working on my speech for a while. The conversations were just simple, meaningless, small talk. The important thing was that I was able to learn to speak to women as people. I was able to build an idea that there need be no stress attached simply to speech. That the stress of speech came, at least in my mind, not from the words or the person I was exchanging those words with, but with the "importance" I placed on those words. I placed importance on being seen as "grownup" or "funny" or "desirable." This meant that when I misspoke, which I should have seen as being a normal thing, I obsessed over it and that ruined me for continued conversation.By the time I was a sophomore I was a changed man. I spoke with conviction. I used words with a maniacal expertise. I had always been better with words than with numbers but I became an expert user of words.It wasn't a perfect solution. I still trip over words, get hung up on a syllable, stutter. That's okay because I have broken past the hang-ups that I had before. I have confirmed to myself that I do know how to speak well and intelligently so it's not something I let myself get too upset over. I found that poor speech is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If I convince myself that I am going to stutter, trip over my words, and misspeak...well, guess what? If on the other hand I go into a conversation with no prior thought as to how well I am going to speak or, even better, with thoughts that I am going to speak well, I'm golden.As far as speaking to women was concerned, I found out a very important thing. Simply speaking to a woman about the everyday things should never be a cause for stress. Women are people too and, in my experience, she may be every bit as nervous talking to you as you are talking to her. Strange, I know, but it has proven itself true time and again.Hope this helps in some way. Break a leg!}}}

Before giving up your dumbo feather though, we'd have to orient you to yourself.To do that, one of the things is to quit using pot to move through the insecure feelings and how you use up time. You need to feel the truth of what is, so you can put your mind to it. In other words, you have to get uncomfortable so you can grow up. You have a chemical booster helping you maintain, constantly in your system. Even if you don't use for a few weeks. You are ashamed and when you get around others eyes, you think they are judging you. You believe you need to live up to others expectations like a kid does to his parents. You might call yourself shy. That's why you have to quit running back to your parents to protect you. Because you were able to avoid dealing with these issues, you didn't learn the nuances and you're now in the next class having missed the basics. This also is a dynamic, so it's like reading about riding a bike. You have to do it yourself as an experience. But throwing someone in the water to swim does work for a few, the rest drown. Get some known social books to understand the basics and communication. Sort of like learning binary in order to code.  But the real issue is that source code of negative talk. Just doing affirmations doesn't work because it is not a reasonable problem. You can't get to the room because it is protected with all kinds of protocols. One of the most important is. 'You can't be reasonable and go in there'. Check rational at the door. That means for a lot of folks, it feels crazy, or not them. That is why you need a guide, someone trained in escorting people down the rabbit hole.You will probably have to shop for one who passes your interview process. Don't feel bad if they don't. And it might require you to reject them after the first session. They should let you leave with a feeling of hope.Save your penny's for therapy. This is your life you're talking about. All your warning bells are going off. Don't wait for the icebergs.}}}

Just wanted to give the full story.1 Comment Loading... }}},{{{First, let's make it clear exactly what "self-talk" is: thinking.You have thoughts automatically and without any intentionality and seemingly very little control popping into your consciousness, consisting of a mixture of mostly words and images. Who else other than yourself are those thoughts "talking" to? Second, it's clear that you don't feel very good about your life, and you've determined that how you think is largely responsible. That's true for everybody: what people think affects how they feel. Third, what you think is a reflection of your mental models (i.e. beliefs) of the world and yourself and everything else that you've ever encountered. For example, when you see a toaster and you want to make toast, you might think "Which setting, 1-5, should I select?" Underlying that thought is the model of the toaster you have in your mind; you know that toasters are for making toast, you know that they have various heat and duration settings, and you know approximately how toasty each setting is. Somebody who has never seen a toaster before might think "Why is there a box with two holes in it in this man's home?" Different mental models, different thoughts (and subsequently different emotions and actions). A decidedly silly example, but I only bring it up to establish the idea that your thoughts are based on your mental models and beliefs. Fourth, we as humans navigate our worlds based on these mental models, which are constantly updating with new information. In terms of surviving, our best hope is to ENSURE THAT THESE MENTAL MODELS ARE AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE. Imagine trying to cross the street with a reversed mental model of walk and stop symbols. Note that it has nothing to do with POSITIVE or NEGATIVE mental models, only ACCURATE mental models. Now let's bring it back to the emotional level. Somebody says something mean to you. You have the thoughts: "Wow, I'm such an idiot for having done [whatever it was that prompted the person to be mean]. I suck at social interactions. I should probably just go home because there's no way I'll have any fun here. I'll never get any better at this sort of thing. I'm going to die alone and unloved." These may be simplistic or exaggerated, but next time you find yourself in one of those tough situations, pay attention to exactly what you're thinking; I think you'll find that it's not so far off in character from the above example. And notice that these thoughts are a reflection of underlying mental models & beliefs. In this case there are beliefs about your culpability for this person's anger, the extent to which he was justified in being mean, your social abilities, your ability to change or improve, your performance in social interactions, and if you dug deeper, probably a lot more. These thoughts are clearly "negative" thoughts, but the question you should be is asking is not, "How do I think more positively?," but "ARE THESE THOUGHTS AND BELIEFS ACCURATE?" If your thoughts are accurate, it would make no sense to think more "positively," because if they are already accurate, then altering them to be more "positive" would only lead to a loss in accuracy, which would lead to increased difficulties in navigating reality. Positive and negative ought to have no bearing on how you judge your thoughts - the only metric ought to be accuracy. Studies have shown that patients suffering from depression and anxiety oftentimes display systemic irrationalities in their thinking, especially about themselves. So, if you're feeling down or scared, take a second to check if your thoughts are accurate and rational. Cognitive therapy has actually developed a catalog of irrationalities and a method of correcting them called the 3 column method. The Irrationalities (sometimes called distortions):1. All or nothing thinking: total black & white thinking; things are usually more grey2. Personalization: thinking things are more about you than they really are3. Mental filter: focusing on one small piece and ignoring other facts or the broader context4. Min/Maximization: taking any feature and blowing it up or totally discounting it5. Disqualifying the positive: discounting any positive outcomes or features of a situation (often while blowing small negatives out of proportion)6. Should: demanding that reality be other than it is; different than setting goals for the future - should's are more condemnations of the present (and of yourself)7. Labeling: boiling a complex reality down to a single label (e.g. loser, failure, idiot, etc.)8. Emotional reasoning: because I feel that X is true, it must be true (e.g. I feel like a failure so I must be a failure)9. Jumping to conclusions: predicting the future (e.g. I'm definitely going to fail) or mind reading (e.g. He thinks I'm an idiot)10. Overgeneralization: taking one or two experiences & generalizing to all of them (e.g. I always make a bad first impression, I never do well on exams)11. Entity thinking: thinking you can never change, that you are a static entityThe 3 Column Method:1. Write down your thoughts2. Identify any and all irrationalities 3. Formulate a RATIONAL and ACCURATE response to the irrational thought (again, not positive, not rosy, just rational and accurate)4. RepeatIf you engage in the process, you'll find that your emotions will have cooled and you'll be in a much better position to take action given the current reality.Note that cognitive therapy has been shown to be the most effective form of therapy in treating anxiety and depression (at least as effective as even antidepressants and anxiety medications; some studies have found it to be more effective). To learn more, research Cognitive Therapy or Cognitive Reframing. Also, the book Feeling Good by David Burns is an excellent place to start.For an easy place to do cognitive restructuring per the 3 column method: Online Cognitive Therapy Tools (reframingapp.herokuapp.com)}}}

Write down all the negative things you say to yourself in one column. In the next column, write down a positive response to each negative thing you wrote in the first column. Keep the list current. Figure out what triggers you to attack yourself: when do you say negative things to yourself is as important (or more) than what it is you do say. By countering what you say to yourself negatively with a different point of view, you remove the sting of the slings and arrows you use to punish yourself.Distract yourself with activities in which you contribute to the lives of others. Notice that you do not negatively self-label when you are helping others.Find a guide. Mike Leary is right, though. Save up for therapy so you can figure out why you are not your own best friend -- and why you were believing such negative things about yourself -- and let that therapist guide you toward a continually improving life. User counterintuitive actions. Your intuition isn't working for you. Go against your 'will' so that you do things outside your normal comfort zone. Start small. For example, go into a restaurant, sit down, ask for a glass of water, and then leave. Do things that you would not ordinarily do. Make them small and harmless things. It is practice so that you step outside your comfort zone and see that you are still 'safe'.Exercise, eat nutritiously, go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every day. We humans are built to have certain needs. Take care of your physical self so the rest of you has a chance to monitor your progress and see a constantly improving self. Success meets with more success, on every level.Monitor your daily feelings with a daily diary. Keep track of how dysphoric you are feeling every morning or every night (or both). For more about monitoring, try Dr. Marsha Linehan's Workbook. It was written for dialectical behavior cognitive therapy for a discrete population, but the workbook is applicable to anyone with self-destructive tendencies.http://www.amazon.com/Training-T...}}}

I was living in self-hatred (with sometime a feeling of moral superiority) and i hated everyone. And for the exact same reason as you, because i did gave a reaction and was verbally/physically abused. Not only at school btw. It took me years to recover, but i did. The fact that you want to be a lifelong learner is actually one of the great thing you could have to help yourself but also paradoxically one that may lead you in the wrong direction.  I've figured out that it's not at all about learning but rather un-learning! It's not all the things you will add on top of the things you already think you know or tell yourself that will help you. You need disappearance more than adding stuff on top of broken foundations. Also knowledge is a very small part of the integration of something. It's not because we have the knowledge of how things work that we are able to do them efficiently. You need practice after the theory if you want to apply it to your life. Otherwise it's pointless. All the knowledge in the world won't help.I'm not a fan of traditional psychology or psychotherapy. I honestly don't think it will help you. I think it's just adding junk or sometimes creating stories that doesn't exist.I've tried a lot of options,  but in your case in the particular self-talk issue those are the best thing for you:1. Meditation: it's oftentimes thought as a religious practice, but what it really is mind training. Just train your mind to not listen inward but outward. It's about helping you concentrate and forget the self . An easy and entertaining introduction to that would be talks by alan watts on youtube. That's the best way to train your brain to stop listening the internal chatter (which is totally natural btw, everyone has it). But do not fool yourself. It takes a lot of hard work and practice to achieve a calm state of mind! Especially from where you're coming from.2. About the negativity try positive psychology (with one of the best teacher):http://www.tudou.com/programs/vi... 3. If you want some rapid progresses try the Landmark forum. I was skeptical about it but really great experience for me: http://www.landmarkeducation.com/I wish you the best with everything. Be patient and work hard and give yourself permission to be the way you are. That's the best advice i can give you ;-)}}}

That means leaving your house and your room and seeking out other people. Call people you know who are down on their luck and offer them support.

You haven't hit rock bottom yet. You are far from it. You have no idea what rock bottom is. Think about those who are in asylum. Who can't tell reality from illusion. Who have such grave problems in their head, compared to which depression, even chronic depression would seem like a Sunday morning break. Imagine if you hear an evil voice in your head all the time.... literally all the time and it drives you mad. I'm talking about schizophrenics. I'm telling you from experience. So, listen to me.2. Who is that person who posted this question? The self destructive depressed folk or kid inside who knows he isn't what you think you are. Trust me, all of that has happened in your life till this moment... is an illusion from now on. This moment is the only reality. And in this moment, you are pure and complete. There is no illness or lacuna in you, it's all in your mind. You are perfect. Today is the first day of the rest of your life.Now,a. First thing you need to do is relax. Take out some time of your day when for the next one hour, nothing is needed of you. You are on your own. For just one hour, don't worry about what will happen, whether you will fix yourself or not. Be totally carefree and detached. Remember your childhood. Ponder over this : Past is an illusion, and so is future. The present moment is all you have. All those events which you run over in you head are no longer there.  They are gone. And if you are hurt, then ask yourself, how much are you hurt because of the actual event, and how much because you keep thinking about it over and over again. Which of the two is greater? If you want to take revenge with people who wronged you, would you also take revenge on yourself?b. Try to forgive people. That is what will give you peace of mind. There is no point holding a grudge. You will ruin your own life. And forgive yourself for everything. Start totally fresh. Apologise to your parents.c. Sleep well. Get up early in the morning and do some exercise. Jogging is good enough. Physical exercise naturally cures depression.d. Help people. Everyday, do something to help others. Expect nothing in return. Feed a poor guy on the streets and look at how grateful he feels. e. Engage yourself. Find some work to do. Do not sit and think. Read books, watch comic shows, laughter helps a lot. And when you start finding some balance, try to find some passion, something that you love to do.f. Live one day at a time. Make short goals. Achieve them. Let your parents know you are doing something. Make them happy.By that time you will find yourself back and laugh at your stupidity.}}}

ACT differs from CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) in that instead of challenging distressing thoughts by looking for evidence and coming up with a more rational response, in ACT, the thought is accepted as a thought, and then defused using three broad techniques: Mindfulness - a way of observing our experience, in the present moment, without judgement. Mindfulness helps us 'defuse' - to distance ourselves from unhelpful thoughts, reactions and sensations.  - “You can’t stop the waves, but you can learn to surf”Acceptance – in general terms trying to rid ourselves of distress only increases it, and turns it into something traumatic.  The alternative is to accept it - but that doesn't mean being defeated or tolerating suffering.  We learn to make room for painful feelings, thoughts, and sensations - allowing them to be there, coming and going without us struggling against them.Commitment and values based living - freeing ourselves from the traps and barriers of life, and seeing what we really want our life to be. This said, I am very mindful of your comments regarding the personality of therapists you have met as I feel this is hugely important. A ‘therapeutic alliance’ describes support that emphasises the collaborative nature of the partnership between the therapist and the individual in receipt of the therapy. A positive relationship may be one of the most important, and most frequently overlooked, variables for predicting a person’s response to an intervention. It accounts for more variance in ‘treatment’ outcomes than any single client related characteristic. The evidence shows that establishing a collaborative partnership and having good interpersonal skills are more important than professional training in achieving positive outcomes. ‘Client’ ratings of the partnership are the most consistent predictor of ‘client’ improvement. If the person doesn’t believe that the therapist can help them change their behaviour, achieve their goals or act in their best interests, then they will be unlikely to achieve the desired outcomes.I wish you all the best.}}}

You have to try out different therapists until you find someone who can understand you well enough and has a good personality himself. Since we are dealing with the most complicated set of disorders (all related to the brain and the mind), we have to develop more patience and try to find some therapist that can work for us.If a definite biological defect is also observed, psychiatry or some other form of physical treatment (e.g. ECT) may also be required.Btw, I don't know if you realize.. tackling ADHD, depression, anxiety etc all by any one type of psychotherapy is akin to treating something like cancer, diabetes and psoriasis all with one type of chemotherapy (or radiotherapy or whatever).

Why do any of us voluntarily consume alcohol, which is after all - a drug?Many people drink alcohol, that does not make them alcoholic. The good effects of alcohol are that it can make us feel more 'socially included', it can make us less inhibited, it is fun to drink with friends.The reason alcohol does this is that it is a 'relaxant' and it is, in limited quantities, a stimulant.The downside of this is that alcohol, in large quantities, is a depressant. In order to achieve 'hangover' status, large quantities of alcohol are consumed. It may well be that the amount of alcohol consumed is affecting 'mood' and that merely reducing the amount consumed, can lead to a reduction of these distressing symptoms.Additionally, alcohol intoxication and withdrawal  can lead to other symptoms, these may be some of the symptoms that you perceive to be related to the hangover:-loss of sensation in the arms or legsloss of muscle powerprofound memory disturbancesa shrunken brain.(www.net doctor.co.uk)Alcohol is associated with an increased risk of suicidal feelings, this is not just found in patients who are 'alcoholic' but in other social drinkers as well.Anecdotally, in our Emergency Department, it is clear that some of our patients who attempt suicide or self-harm, do so because they are under the influence of alcohol. Again, this may correlate to a certain extent with your own symptoms.My advice would be, if you are worried about your drinking overall, seek face to face advice. However, if you are merely an occasional and social drinker, you may find that these symptoms can be reduced by drinking less and avoiding binge drinking.}}}

I do not get this when I don't drink other than when I am very dehydrated or have had a lot of caffeine. }}},{{{I am answering this question both for you as well as for those who might be alcohol dependent.  No judgement is implied, I just believe in giving a comprehensive answer that a spectrum of people can benefit from.  My answer contains some theoretical leaps since so much is unknown about the pathology of alcoholism, but you will find enough support to see that I am not purely speculating.Anxiety is a known symptom of alcohol withdrawal and is best treated by avoiding alcohol consumption and thereby avoiding withdrawal.  Understanding the possible causes of this condition can help you perhaps mitigate it while continuing to enjoy alcohol on a recreational basis, but quitting cold turkey may result in even more severe symptoms (seizures, DT's, and death) if you are currently alcohol dependent.  If you believe that you cannot manage your withdrawal symptoms please get to a physician since alcohol withdrawal can be life threatening.In animal studies there is a growing body of evidence that points to dynamic changes in GABAa benzodiazepine receptor plasticity and subunit conformation as it relates to alcohol withdrawal, either after acute administration or in a chronic intermittent withdrawal paradigm.  The result of these studies points to an increase of alpha4 containing subunits of the GABAa receptor and decrease of alpha1 containing subunits.  Clinically this switch is recognized in humans as benzodiazepine insensitivity in chronic alcoholics, but acute benzodiazepine insensitivity is also possible acutely after binge drinking, or after a very long time of intermittent drinking.  The alpha1 subunit is sensitive to modulation by benzodiazepines (xanax, librium, etc...) whereas the alpha4 subunit is considered less "sticky" as a binding site for these drugs.  Clinicians will give alcoholics in withdrawal doses of librium that would knock a normal, benzodiazepine sensitive individual on their ass.An increase of alpha4 subunits of the GABAa receptor is correlated with an increase risk for seizures as well as a marked increase in anxiety.  It is rapidly induced in vitro as well as animal studies through acute administration of alcohol followed by withdrawal.  In the initial tests, the receptors tend to snap back on their own, but chronic intermittent withdrawal results in a gradual shift towards more alpha4 containing subunits and less alpha1 containing subunits.  In other words constant drinking and withdrawal can lead to a situation where the brain does not "snap" back as easily.  Interestingly enough this switch seems to be mediated by neurosteroids and is also identified as potentially being related to pre-menstrual and post-partum anxiety.Now to get back to your question which is what you can do about the anxiety you suffer the morning after you drink:If you are not a chronic drinker then try to take some time off from drinking to let your brain snap back if possible.  However if you feel your anxiety increasing then please get to a physician because alcohol withdrawal can be life threatening.  If you are a chronic drinker then visit a physician and tell him that you want to undergo a "detox" protocol to abstain from alcohol.If you do continue to drink then try to consume less alcohol and over less time.  In the in vitro and animal studies the change in receptor subunit conformation takes approximately 48 hours of acute alcohol administration on a naive system (never had alcohol before).  I will take a leap here and suggest to you that the human equivalent is either extensive binge drinking, or continuous daily drinking.  Take breaks and lower your intake.  Do not drag out your dose of alcohol and allow your brain to marinade for too long.  It may be that moderating your drinking to a certain level will reduce the morning after anxiety you experience.  We often drink way too much, not because we need it, but because it feels like the right thing to do.  Put more thought into how much you drink.Look at other medications that you are taking that might compound the effects of alcohol on this neurosteroid mediated pathway on your brain.  These include oral contraception (if you are female), anti-anxiety medication, benzodiazepines, prescription sleep medication, nicotine, and other drugs that impact the brain (legal or illegal).  Try to think of what you are exposing your brain to and you may come to realize that you may be medicating an underlying condition using several different agents including alcohol.  On the other hand you may realize that you were feeling better before you combined several substances or medications.  Please discuss your thoughts with a physician- psychiatrists know quite a bit about both anxiety and alcohol and many of them are credentialed to deal with alcohol and drug dependencies.Look into trying to normalize your receptor subunit conformation by doing research into compounds such as miltirone that have been shown to inhibit the upregulation of alpha4 subunits in alcohol withdrawal in rats.  I only mention this compound since it comes from a rather innocuous plant (salvia miltiorrhiza) that has been used traditionally in traditional chinese medicine for centuries.  The identical compound (chemically) has also been isolated in Rosemary and is referred to as rosmariquinone. I am not condoning any form of risky experimentation or treatment- just sharing what I have found.}}}

I found the following which seems as good a place as any to start:-Talking to an individual – It is great to maintain eye contact when talking to a person however it can become a bit creepy and uncomfortable if you stare intensely at them. To combat this, break eye contact every 5 seconds or so. When breaking the eye contact don’t look down as this might indicate the ending of your part of the conversation. Instead, look up or to the side as if your are remembering something. Try it just now: don’t move your head, and think about the first time you started school. You will notice your eyes might move up or to the side as you try to remember this. So when your listener sees this they will think you are trying to remember something and keep on listening to you.Listening to someone – When you are listening to someone it can be off putting for the talker if you stare at them too hard. The technique I use when I am counseling someone is to use what I call ‘The triangle’. This is when I look at one eye for about 5 seconds, look at the other eye for 5 seconds and then look at the mouth for 5 seconds and keep on rotating in this way. This technique coupled with other listening skills such as nodding, occasional agreement words such as ‘yes’, ‘Uh –huh’ ‘mm’ etc is a great way to keep the talker talking and to show them you are interested in what they are saying.(stevenaitchison.co.uk)}}}

I understand technically the subject isn't meant to notice, but in my experience they do, and when they do, it's a very awkward conversation. I don't actually tend to make that much eye contact, and have found that if I don't mention it then usually others don't either. If you throw your voice towards the person, and make it as tonally variable as possible, at times they can forget about eye contact, this mostly works for me, it also oddly gives my eye contact more power whenever I do use it and it's a fantastic weapon in debates.  Whenever I have to make eye contact, and I am not going out to look ultra-intense and stare someone down I tend to look at the eyes, BUT not make contact. I do not focus on the pupil, more the iris or the eyelashes, which gives the illusion of eye contact, however it took me a while to get comfortable with this and when I started trying to make eye contact I would look at the eyebrows, or just below the eyes. From what I've observed this works better than looking at the nose. However, I think that eye contact for people who aren't used to, or awkward about making it is about personal technique. That is, you need to find something you are comfortable with, the other answerers and I can detail techniques until the dawn but it doesn't mean they will definitely work. I'm not saying jump in and make mental eye contact everywhere, I'm saying, of course, use these techniques, but they will only work if you are able to be comfortable with them. It's a personal thing, and I wish you luck in your endeavor.}}}

You'll get plenty of general knowledge on the subject just by typing your exact question into Google.But much of what you'll find on the web will only cover the skills, techniques and benefits of eye contact. There's probably less information on how to 'make a start' if you're finding it quite a challenge to begin with. Here's a suggestion, if you're a little shy however you'll need to push through the shyness just enough to allow you to put this outgoing (but fun) exercise into practice. It will work if you do, 100%.Have a camera? Any kind will do, even just the one on your phone.Start with friends and family, here's your introduction line ''Hi there, I'm doing a personal project on peoples facial expressions as they go about their day to day routines. Would you be happy for me to take 3 very quick portrait snap shots while you're just being yourself? It'll take less than a minute''. Raise your eyebrows, smile, look at the bridge of their nose, right between their eyebrows as you wait for their answer, after about 4 seconds tilt your head a tiny bit and glance at their chin, then ear, then back to between their eyebrows, then down to the camera in your hand.Once you've got the OK, say thanks! Snap the first shot, say ''that's great, just 2 more, now could you look right into the camera for me, relax your shoulders so I can get the 'real you' ''.Smiling again and gently nodding your head. Take the 2 shots, thank them sincerely, offer to show them what you've just taken. They'll remark, just tell them the pics are really useful to your research subject. They might start chatting about what the research is going to be used for.So make it a real research project for 3 days on the specific topic of eye expressions in daily life. Purely for your personal study, you're quite into psychology. And you can even drop by and see them again once your project is done and let them know what you've concluded. Now once you've done this with a couple of friends it's time to venture out!Someone who's familiar with you, a shopkeeper perhaps. Go for it, repeat the above procedure, make it easy going. Have fun with it. Then go to another place, again the person should be someone who's seen you around before, not a complete stranger. And don't be put off if somebody refuses, just say ''no problem, completely understand, thanks anyway'' and move on. Some people will say no, you absolutely should not let that deter you from continuing, plenty will say yes as well.If you can just snap 10 people over the period of 3 days that's enough.There will be a point during this process when your aversion to eye contact will dissolve. The more enthusiasm you put into this the faster it will happen.Why? Because the camera alters the psychological dynamics between you and your photographic subject instantly and brings the person into a state of compliance and they will see your camera as your eyes. In turn, you will be able to look directly into their eyes through the camera lens with no discomfort whatsoever. And after just a few repetitions of the process you will find that you can comfortably make natural eye contact without the camera. Do this with bravado and you will find that people 'give you their eyes' for the purpose of your study, and when they do that - you will feel something very empowering happen to you.You can actually go back to someone after you're done, and tell them exactly what the project was really about! ''I used to have difficulty making eye contact, it's not uncommon, and this was my research into a method of dissolving that psychological barrier. Thanks to you're participation it was a success!''If you are too shy to carry this project out, tell me.

Maybe that will help with the too intense thing.I don't feel any particular way when looking at someone's eyes, its just not a habit so I rarely look at any particular part of them. Its a struggle to remember to try. I have gotten better at it recently. Not much better, I forget most of the time.

Another technique is to actively try to disengage from the person I am looking at, and pretend I am talking to someone else in the room that I can't see. These techniques may not work for you... but I think it is good to understand exactly what effect looking directly in someones eyes has on you, in order to either minimize the negative experience (if you have one - like I do), or attempt to cultivate or encourage the positive experience or response you hope to recieve from it (such as a deeper engagement in dialog or feeling of connection, with the person you interact with).}}}

It is setting up a classic "fight or flight" so you do not release the stare if you are in danger. So the key to good eye contact during normal conversation is to relieve this tension. I find what works best for me is to maintain intense eye contact while I am listening. Then, it is the job of the person currently speaking to relieve the tension. This happens naturally for many people, because when they are trying to remember something, or visualizing something, they will glance off or glance up for a second. This is a natural reaction, and it breaks the tension. After breaking the tension you look at them again.And while the speaker breaks the tension, that is a good moment for the listener to quickly look away and then back again.}}}

I've found that this lets me maintain eye contact without getting nervous- it gives me something to think about.Also, it's easiest to start maintaining eye contact while the other person is talking, and work your way up to it while you're talking.

If you think to yourself you are coming over to ask for a date, or get approval, or get a woman to like you, that's putting a lot of pressure on yourself, and it's probably not even true. Check in with yourself and remind yourself what your intent is. Most likely it's that you want to say hi, and, potentially get to know the woman. Not in a date, just in a small-talk, how's it going, kind of way. Lower the stakes. Treat it like talking to a person in an elevator or the pizza guy. 2. Remember that we want you to approach. Maybe not you exactly, but men don't approach enough. Unless a woman is a stuck up beast, if a guy approaches in a friendly way, it's never a bad thing. 3. If you feel anxious it makes the woman anxious. Be friendly, be kind, be interesting.}}}

If they don't want to talk to strangers, that's a choice you should respect.  You can just say hi to the next person.  Then by the time you see someone you're attracted to, you can more easily reframe as Andrea suggests above.  They'll just be one more person you're talking to as you go through your day.If you do this you will become someone who just likes to talk to people. You'll talk to lots of different people.  You'll be a more interesting person for all the people you've met, and you'll be at ease starting conversations with strangers.  I'm a shy person by nature, so I still feel a little anxiety with the first stranger or two I talk to each day, but I get a lot less anxiety than I used to and it's a lot easy to reframe even with the first person.}}}

His girlfriend had left him recently and I thik he wanted someone to talk to and releae some pressure. So he called up the girl, set up an appointment and went to see her.He wrote that it helped him a lot! Even his psychologist told him it is a good idea. So he started visiting girls regularly(as much as he could moneywise). With time he met few girls he liked and connected with and became a regular customer. Later he experienced that depressions have returned but it wasn't that bad as before. With time he got better even though he wanted to talk to the girls more than the sex it self. When he talked to those few girls he kind of tapped to their life-is-good energy and started to feel more optimistic about things.I'v read few similar stories so I think that it can help quite a lot to a man. I don't know about the anxiety(I have it too but not that severe) but in my opinion it helps too.A friend of mine went to see a hooker few months ago for the first time and even thogh it didn't go well(first time + the girl wasn't too friendly) he told me that the next day he felt like a superhero(verry confident and hight self-esteem).To sum it up I think sex is one of the most powerfull cure there is for (almost)any psychological problem. I personally don't have a moral problem with hookers and I think that saving a virginity is as stupid as --fill your own stupid belief-- but we are all living in different envirnoments and are affected by different things so eventually it is up to you what you will do with your life.}}}

This means your concern is less about a physical or mental addiction to alcohol and more about social anxiety which you feel is an innate part of who you are. I have to say you are just a younger guy looking for some confidence. The best way to get this is to engage in activities that "build you up". Working out, reading, joining social groups or clubs where there is a structure place, outside of work, to interact with peers will do this. So build a routine that builds you up week over week. Less thinking, more doing. Before you know you'll just naturally feel great and won't even think of things like alcohol, which you are clearly not physically addicted to like others - who would have different responses written for them entirely.}}}

I'm just sharing what I've learned through research and case studies. If taken daily (as opposed to PRN or as needed/occasionally), many people develop dependency, tolerance and "relative withdrawal" (it's a very serious decision), but there is plenty of "old" 80s/90s research on Clonazepam's/Klonopin's effectiveness for social anxiety disorder, even over long periods of time. I'm mobile or I'd find the research done by Liebowitz and Heimburg when social phobia was first put in the DSM. Other than the tolerance,  and "worse than heroine" withdrawal that some people claim (again, doesn't happen to everyone everyone and not if tapered properly), there are usually immediate short term memory effects and often long term negative cognitive effects that are important to be aware of and are more problematic for elderly (research supports this).In said "old" research, Clonazepam/Klonopin is sometimes compared with Nardil, an older class of anti-depressant, MAOI, with a unique effect on the GABA-A  receptor (same receptor that Clonazepam and Alcohol are agonists of) that often benefits people immensely. It can have significant (e.g. gain A LOT of weight, not just some weight), severe (e.g. severe insomnia) and potentially deadly side effects. You can't eat certain foods or you can have a hypertensive episode that will kill you. Often a beta blocker is prescribed as a safety pill just in case you start to have an episode. Also, Nardil is notorious for its "poop out" along with another MAOI Parnate. The stories of this are sometimes brutal. I've read that this may have contributed to David Foster Wallace's suicide, but I don't know this for sure. He was taking an MAOI.In legal territory, research points to these as the most effective, but they carry significant risks and I (my opinionion) recommend against them. Also, you'll find it harder to locate a doc to prescribe either for long term use, unless it's one of the 35 to 45k psychiatrists we have left in the country who are usually a bit older and aren't as likely to fear prescribing them. New docs instead opt to throw SSRIs at everything, often when they are little more effective than placebo for a particular disorder with side effects that are not fun for many (e.g. anorgasmia and/or no libido).Something you might consider discussing with your doctor for off-label prescription is Baclofen. A recent French/Swiss study found it to be effective for the treatment of alcohol addiction at an effectiveness rate substantially higher than commonly used interventions today. The only reason the large study even happened, given the medication is long out of patent, was because one rich guy with a drinking problem (I assume this) donated something like $750,000 to have it done after reading the book The End of My Addiction by a brilliant, alcoholic French doctor and his experience with it. It targets the GABA-B receptor, has in some cases quickly stopped decades of battling addiction for many people, has a calming effect because its a muscle relaxant (also something you have to be careful about) and research indicates it doesn't have the same abuse/tolerance issues that benzodiazepines like Clonazepam do. Now, the research has only been done with a focus on stopping moderate to severe addiction, but there are smaller/case studies for what one might call "preventative" treatment, in that at low doses it can give a calming effect so that alcohol is not desired. For people coming from a history of addiction, they go to a high dose then when they stop drinking, slowly taper to a maintenance dose.That's just what I know for running a mental health community for a few years now. Don't take action on any of this without consulting your doctor first, preferably a doctor who is familiar with the medications. And my opinion...medication should be your second line of treatment after trying evidence based individual/group CBT and soon there'll be a body of research for DBT as well (think CBT+Mindfulness).Just remember. There's always hope. Good luck! :)}}}

This is the worst solution. A longer-term solution is to drink steadily for years until your system is basically constantly saturated by small amounts of alcohol, even when you aren't drinking. This is also a bad solution.Alcohol stifles inhibition, which humans have to stop themselves from doing stupid things. When confronted with a risk, think about what stands to be lost and gained from the risk; is the potential gain worth the potential loss? When the loss is something like emotional distress (I asked the girl out and she said "no"), alcohol has the added effect, for some people, of blunting that feeling (providing "confidence"). Another way of blunting those feelings are to feel them frequently, so you get used to them; in other words, if you make those small risks until you are accustomed to the loss, they will no longer be risks, and you will no longer need alcohol to cope with them.}}}

Amazingly, I discovered that others have dealt with many dilemmas already, and came up with solutions, so just by listening I can get a whole lot of life experience without making the same mistakes.Another thing was the "yes/no" responses that others would give, and then the conversation would just die.So, I stopped allowing others a chance to sit back and let me do the talking by starting the question with, "I need your opinion on this.." and making it a neutral and open-ended question.It appears that people like flattery (asking their opinion is very flattering) and neutral tone would let them show their true colors.

I suspect it will do him good and he probably secretly wants to go out and have fun but just doesn't know how to overcome his depression and anxiety. I am going to do two things in this answer. I would like to relay to you what your friend may be experiencing, so that you may have a better understanding and perhaps your responses can be tailored to draw a positive result from your friend in the majority of cases. Then I will fill you in on some techniques that work in getting me out of my house (which is difficult sometimes).To most people anxiety about people looking at you all the time, or everyone making negative comments about the way you look, or talk, occurs, but is a temporary terror. It passes and you go out and do your thing despite having had that thought. But some people, for so many varied reasons, can't get that thought to stop running in their heads. That thought rises to the forefront of their experience so that everything else that happens when they are out in public is perceived through this distorted lens. They want it to stop, but they seemingly have little control over their thoughts. This is frustrating and causes stress, which is typically manifested in strange tense contortions of the body and face. This outward awkwardness makes everything worse and more real. People who get anxiety have an avalanche of thoughts, feelings, and responses going on inside them every moment. At some point, it becomes easier to just forget it and go home.Anxiety comes from wanting to please people around you.Depression is a response to thinking you haven't pleased people around you.I know these statements are sweeping and not applicable in all cases but I think they provide some insight into social anxiety.Some things you can do to coax your friend out of his lair:Tempt him with low risk outings. (Does he hate crowds? How about the beach? Or not afraid of kids as much as adults, go to the aquarium.)Ratchet up - Once on a low risk outing, gauge interest in going to a more risky place next.Play down the social factor and play up the experience he will have. What if he would never be able to see this band again? Or that he would remember this adventure forever.Let him know you are there for him as a friend and that you think he is just fine looking and a great guy. If you think he can deal with it, talk to him about his anxiety. Sometimes saying what you are afraid of out loud shrinks your fears back to human sized.With some of my friends I verbally point out each time they say something self-deprecating. I tell them I don't think that and they shouldn't either, because it's not true. (This either works great or they just stopped telling me those things because I was annoying.)This answer was not meant to be comprehensive. The topics of anxiety and depression contain volumes of information that could be presented here. But, I hope this gives you a little view into your friend's mind-state and a little guidance in how to get him to go out and have a good time.}}}

Their perceptions about themselves and how others view them is one of the core struggles they experience.  For most people, it is difficult for them to understand the intensity of the feelings anxiety suffers are experiencing.I would find out how significant the symptoms are in his life. If they are preventing him from carrying on daily life activities such as a job, than your friend has some major challenges.  These challenges would be best addressed by getting him to see a specialist.  In some cases, this could require both medication and talk therapy. Getting him to commit to one or the other as a starting point should be the primary focus of your intervention.  I would also encourage soliciting the help of other people in his life to get him the help he needs.}}}

"Let's go to the park and hang out" is code for "let's go to the park and I'll sit there with nothing to do and dwell on how obvious it is that I have nothing to do and I don't know what I'm doing here and the more I think about it the more everyone can tell... freak out!!!"verbally rehearse the evening with them - go over the details, what's expected of them, what to expect. Sometimes they may need this several times, and will ask for clarification on details that you think are unimportant. They might be unimportant to you, but inside that person's head it's a big deal whether or not they know this information.verbalizing your own social anxiety but with happy endings "sometimes I feel like my clothes don't fit and I don't want to leave the house, but then when I get to where I'm going I don't even care anymore because I'm just glad to be there." BE SINCERE in this step, and make it a consistent habit. If you only break this out during periods of high anxiety you will not have successentertain hypothetical problems and collaboratively come up with solutions to those hypothetical problems. "What if Bob sits next to me?" "What if Bob sits next to you? What are our options? Which option are you most comfortable with? What should I do as your friend if Bob sits next to you?"make social plans zero risk - like it or not you are a factor in their anxiety. They worry that if they make plans with you and back out you won't care for them anymore. Make it clear that you are spending time with them because you value their friendship, and if they once and awhile simply can't get out the door make it clear to them that that's fine and there are no consequences. If you pressure anxiety people to do social things they don't want to do or hold a grudge against them you will quickly become a source of anxiety and either the anxious symptoms you want to avoid will become more persistent when you're around or they'll stop making plans with youplan an exit strategy - "we can go to this restaurant, and if it's not good then we'll just do x instead"}}}

I was fat, we were poor (and my mother dressed me funny as a result) and I read ALL the time in grade seven and eight. I was stalked, beaten, tormented and ran a gamut of physical abuse just getting into classrooms. Any friends I made were turned against me, forcing me to end up in fights with them. I was a big, strong kid under the fat, so that meant I ended up hurting people I liked, which sucked a lot.I'm in a happy, long-term relationship with a beautiful and intelligent woman, I have a successful and lucrative career that has taken me all over North and South America and now has me in Singapore. As volunteer giveback I maintain an influential blog debunking wind energy disinformation (barnard on wind). I have friends and acquaintances around the world. I'm fit and active.By most standards, I've vastly exceeded the socio-economic, cultural and emotional expectations that would align with my upbringing, regardless of bullying.I don't run into kids from the small Northern Ontario town where this occurred all that often. I haven't been back for 20 years or so. Perhaps 25 years ago, I visited and went to a local bar.  One of my primary tormentors from grade 7/8 was there. I was consumed by rage and wanted nothing more than to beat him to a pulp, which I was certainly capable of.He, on the other hand, was consumed by guilt and self-loathing. Crying, he apologized for his awful behaviour and begged my forgiveness. For context, I was starting the successful career I mentioned, and he was a security guard in a bus station. I was lean, he was fat. I was married, he was single. Etc. He was a pretty hopeless case, despite being moderately intelligent. (I have no idea how he turned out in the end. Maybe he's a multi-millionaire CEO who attends Davos, gives TED talks and adopts stray African puppies. But I doubt it.)I didn't beat him into a pulp and at the time I was consumed with frustration by his apology that prevented it (not that I was big on beating anyone up). I had to settle for vicious happiness at his squalid life, which I don't regret but have moved on from of course.Now I just realize that everyone suffers emotionally from bullying, and that who suffers more isn't obvious for a long time.}}}

Different people react different ways. Some people may experience "minor" bullying and are able to not internalize what has happened, keeping the behavior on the other person, that has nothing to do with them. Other people may experience the same thing and internalize it and experience emotional or psychological harm that may need professional help to fix.  Others may be tortured and stalked by their bully over a period of time and they might develop problems as a result, and again, need professional help to overcome that. There is no shame in asking for professional help. If you need it you need it. I know that I waited 3 years to get help after a stalking and I wish I hadn't waited so long because it made such a difference. I got my life back!  And I'm mentally healthy and it still caused a bunch of problems.If the bullying is physical, and you are physically harmed then the recovery will require both physical and mental health care. You can and should start this professional help even before you get the bullying to stop. The skills you are taught will help you in so many ways, including getting your bully to leave you alone.}}}

I was bullied from 4th grade all the way through 9th grade. It was just day-in-day-out torture. I hated school in that period. I always studied and got great grades but doing well academically isn't really the best recipe to stay out of the bullying focus. I felt bad about studying and getting good grades and it has never got me any true pleasure since then. Once I had focused my studying attitude into, "I'll show them!", I could never re-focus it to, "I want to do this because I love it" or even "I am going to do the best job I can because I owe that to myself" or anything of the like. Sure, on the surface I can repeat those mantras to myself but I could never convince myself with them on the inside.  To add insult to injury; I was an outsider: I came from a different country than most people in my school, I spoke a different dialect of Arabic than most students which made communication harder (and my sentences and wording easier to mock). I had no true friends for these years and made only virtual ones. I was lonely. Angry.    Does it get better? It does but yes, some damage has been persistent in my case. I like to think it is not permanent and it might fade with time but so far; it hasn't. My high school years (grades 10 through 12) were the best: I spent them in a school full of foreigners (like myself but of a different nationality). I made friends all over the place. I studied hard and smart. I slept well. I listened to metal music but not with the same bitterness or anger. I have since went on to study engineering and graduate and get a job I wanted. The "overall" recovery of bullying is easy and I like to think I have done that.  Of course bullying doesn't just work on your "overall" level. It doesn't stop at face-value. So yes, my "confidence" can get me places and can help me accomplish things. But inside, on a subtle level, I know that I am deeply inconfident and extremely insecure, worried and uncertain. A big psychological fact is the "spotlight effect": we overestimate how much attention people we don't know are really giving us. But I think in my case; I overdo that. I am constantly aware of looks, gazes, words and opinions. I think and obsess over words that people could have just said in passing. And I believe I was not that person before my bullying started. I continue to be that person after it ended. I work on it, I do the things I love and try to find things I am good at and learn them and try to brush the "spotlight" thoughts away. But even when I am learning something, when I am thinking of trying something new: I find myself automatically setting invisible bars I cannot cross for myself. I simply cannot help doing that.  So I guess you cope. But you never really cope. You can't ever really cope. If anything, the fleeting images of laughter, mockery, pointing and shoving are still vivid and fresh in my head and it only takes one memory from that period, even if it's irrelveant, to bring them all back.}}}

Focus intently on the words this attractive person is saying, the sound of their voice, the feel of your feet on the floor, the smells in the room, etc. Or pretend you're a visitor from the future studying this primitive person and their environment. Taking your focus out of your head, away from the internal struggle you're unlikely to win, and onto something involving your present senses can help defuse the problematic thoughts/feelings.And, if you can do it once, it'll be a little easier the next time around.

That is to say it's the absence of something rather than its presence. I'd suggest that your compulsion - and compulsion is at the heart of your question - is operating on two different levels. 1) You don't want to allow the superficial component of someone else's physical beauty to affect or influence you in a way that subtracts from your own self-worth or ability to present yourself as an intelligent, attractive human being. You don't want to be consumed by it and thrown off your game. And 2) You realize on some level that it's fleeting and impermanent and fear if you look away from it time will pass and it will be gone. So it's a tricky compulsion because you're looking to both ignore and preserve it.As I've gotten older (and as a man observing female beauty) I've found that, if appropriate, acknowledging physical attractiveness directly serves well on several levels. If you're a casual acquaintance or friend then a simple, direct compliment ("wow .. you look great tonight") both diffuses the tension somewhat and takes some of the unstated discomfort off the table. Even if you're being introduced for the first time it isn't the worst thing you could say after "pleasure to meet you." It puts physical attraction in its proper place .. undeniable but also unearned outside of whatever care is taken by the subject to enhance. This isn't to say you go on and on about it, and obviously it wouldn't be appropriate in, say, and academic setting when being introduced to a peer. That said, the truth is most women will appreciate it even if their outward response is indifference or deflection (and it will allow you to move on to more important things like who they are.)}}}

They can be looking at something as simple as a steak knife and imagine it being used for violent purposes.In your question details you talk about your OCD with respect to attractive people. You say that when you are looking at attractive people on the internet and you're not thinking a positive thought, you have to then "redo" the act of looking at her and thinking positively.You say that when you're with attractive people "try to avoid any thought that might have to do with them acknowledging the idea of me looking at them."It's actually not uncommon for people to experience OCD around things they deem to be forbidden.I know one person with OCD who felt it was immoral for her to act on her various sexual desires. She would be consumed by guilt when she had feelings of sexual attraction and would have an image of her having sex with someone that would be difficult to remove from her mind. She would get obsessed with that image, and then have to leave.With you, it sounds like you feel it is either immoral or there is something undesirable about you noticing that someone is attractive.You feel you must have positive thoughts when looking at attractive people.I don't know how you're currently being treated for OCD, but I recommend three approaches for this based on what I've seen work for people with OCD.The first is cognitive behavioral therapy. In this case you'd need to go over the specific logic in your head that for whatever reason makes you feel like you can't notice the attractiveness of people and that you must redo that with a positive thought. You need to remove whatever assumptions are fueling that. Basically in therapy you would try to understand why you're doing what you're doing and stop it. This can be effective. The second approach is exposure therapy. I knew someone who always thought she had dirt on her face. So they put ketchup on her nose and put her in a room full of people and forced her to have conversations. That type of intense unpleasantness helped her to get over her thoughts about dirt. It helped her realize that it was really not the end of the world if she had dirt on her face and that life could go on even if the dirt was there. In your case, I imagine a situation where you were forced to notice someone's attractiveness and then carry on a conversation, or look at pictures without a positive thought that's in mind and just keep going. The third approach is an SSRI or comparable antidepressant. They're really effective for OCD. Think of them as a turbo charger. Basically they'll make your OCD lessen big time. You'll notice a lot fewer symptoms. If you combine that with other therapeutic techniques you'll just experience a lot less distress in situations that you currently find distressful. By doing that, even if it's only temporary, it could really help you get the breakthrough you need to deal with your OCD in this specific situation.I know you might just feel run of the mill nervousness, but it's really important to deal with the underlying OCD first and eliminate it, because if you do that, then the other problems will become much easier to deal with, because there won't be that mental block that keeps invading when you have conversations with attractive women. Further you won't have to be nervous that your OCD will pop up. After that, it's more therapy and exposure, and just experience with attractive people to realize they're no big deal. CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) can address your anxiety around women. Repeated exposure can help get you used to them. Antidepressants will reduce your anxiety levels around them, and if you choose, you can go off antidepressants after they've given you the boost and experience you needed.So this is the multi-pronged approach that I'd suggest if you were my close friend. My feeling is that people with OCD and nervousness do get over these things. I've seen it happen time and time again.}}}

Everyone is nervous/embarrassed/shy to some extent when being in the presence of someone they find attractive because you're immediately trying to cut out any negative judgments they might make toward you. Because, being human, we all have flaws and insecurities. There really is no quick fix for this because its natural and you can't beat biology. What you should do is realize that you are NOT the only person in the world with the problem. There are other people that struggle with this but put themselves out there anyway like they've got nothing to lose. That attractive person will probably find you less attractive if you have nothing to say. That attractive person has found another person attractive before and more than likely been in the same situation. Look good, feel good, and you'll be okay :)}}}

Normally I do not have any social problems but this. I have no problems talking to anyone else, and unless someone particularly attractive is in an audience, I don't have a problem giving effective presentations or speeches. The minute I see an attractive person, I try to avoid any thought that might have to do with them acknowledging the idea of me looking at them. I feel undermined, almost threatened. Sometimes I even feel myself getting warmer. I rarely feel this around people. Now it'd make sense if I viewed myself as unattractive, which I do not - based on what other people have told me about my appearance. I also have obsessive compulsive disorder. I believe that attractive people are triggers for compulsions. For example, when I'm on the internet and I see a woman I am very attracted to physically, I have to make sure that I am thinking a positive thought.

Why?I just found this article that claims people with certain medical conditions, including asthma, are more likely to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.What Are Anxiety Disorders?Why is this? }}},{{{I can't say about the overall correlation for people across the board, but I will tell you my personal experience as a person who has both asthma and panic attacks.I've been having panic attacks since I was a little kid. I've never quite been able to identify the source, as I'm typically not doing anything stressful when they occur. In fact, more often than not I'm lying or sitting down, either trying to fall asleep or just relaxing. For me they come with an intense feeling in my chest, an inability to be comfortable (I simultaneously feel the need to curl in on myself and stretch out completely), an inability to inhale full breaths, the feeling of being smothered, feeling light-headed, and a sort of detachment from myself and my body. Essentially I feel totally out of control of my body; something that I hate completely and only makes the situation worse. Couple that with my embarrassment at the situation if I'm in public, it takes a little while to calm myself down.  About six months to a year ago, I was diagnosed with exercise induced asthma. This means unless I'm doing a lot of physical activity, I'm pretty much okay in the breathing department. But that doesn't mean it never affects me during normal activity, especially since some of my life habits don't help the situation.  I've only had a couple of panic attacks since the diagnosis, but I've noticed it's made it harder for me to get a grasp on the situation.  The whole time I'm trying to breath and calm myself down during a panic attack, all I can think is "Oh my god, what happens if I can't catch my breath." This was already my main issue, but knowing that I have asthma on top of everything else only makes it that much worse.  Needless to say I end up in a bit of a vicious circle.  When I feel a panic attack coming on, I feel pressed for time to get it under control before I can't catch my breath.  This makes me more conscious about my asthma, making my worry increase and it harder to stay calm. Anxiety goes up, breathing becomes more difficult, starting the process over again.  It definitely takes me longer to get a hold of myself, and makes it hard to stop the attack before it gets too intense.So point being, when you have a medical condition that is ever present and affects your life dramatically (aka the very necessary ability to breathe), it makes you more susceptible to anxiety. Things that used to be easy may now set off this condition and make you uncomfortable at best and at worse threaten your life.}}}

I totally know what you mean about the diminished information when communicating only with voice.This may seem curt, but the way I got over it was constantly reminding myself that it's just not a big deal. Orbiting my anxiety was usually the thought that the person on the other side of the line also felt discomfort being on the phone. But, when you really think about it, the majority of people don't even hesitate when calling or answering a phone. To them it's an utterly ordinary event hardly of note. When they hang up, they have PLENTY else to think about other than dwelling on a quick phone call, like - "what to do now, where and what to eat, what's so and so doing, my toe kind'a hurts, i'm sleepy", and so on. Especially if you're calling a place of business, where people generally spend a lot of their day on the phone and have no qualms about it.If you really do feel dread or unable to pick up the phone, consider talking to a professional about it.

As I said, everyone is different and what helps others may not help you.  If you feel you have a really severe problem here that affects your job and day to day life I'd suggest seeing a psychologist about it.  They have jobs for a reason, and seeing one doesn't make you weak or crazy. You're emotionally responding to something subconsciously - somewhere within you, you know why and that understanding can help you move past your fears. If you can do it on your own, that's great too.  But since you're here, you already know there's no shame in asking for help... there's also no shame in seeing a professional about it, provided you have some insurance that can cover it.If you don't - get some.  It's important to take care of yourself.}}}

No need to be validated, just say hi. Or walk up to someone and say, "you look interesting and i just wanted to say hi. I'm <your name here>." Start there and push on as you grow more comfortable. If you have bad days, worry not. Perhaps the next day you will have the inner reserves of courage to climb further.Does this issue bother you when speaking to males in your cohort? Friends? Family?}}}

You could also film yourself to target and improve your weak spots. No pitch will ever be perfect, and VCs are used to working with shy/techy people. If they get a feeling that you are passionate and determined about your venture, they will see it and possibly give you guidance. Do not hesitate to ask for feedback after you make a pitch. This might seem counter intuitive at first, but it shows diligence and a sense of self critic, two hugely important qualities. Good luck.And always remember that the worst thing that can happen is that they refuse to back up your venture. Good luck.}}}

So, I'm not a freak? You mean, I was born this way?Personally, I find this incredibly comforting.Now I can stop beating myself up for what I thought was my fault.OK, I still beat myself up, but I do this less now than I used to, before.UNDERSTANDING depression has been useful in re-framing personal relationships, adding a critical layer of context that has helped me heal.Example: my relationship with my parents, whom I spent many years resenting and grieving about "that unconditional parental love I fantasize to deserve but never got".I could have done better with easier parents, but now I realize, my parents could have done better with an easier child than a child like me.I understand now how hard my parents tried. Their intentions were noble but their execution sucked beyond belief.Because I understand how depression works on me, I am able to accept my parents' intentions and forgive their trespasses.AWARENESS of depression has allowed me to live.I'm under no delusion that I'm going to one day "snap out of it", so I stop wasting my time waiting until I snap out of it to do what I want with my life.Most non-depressed people view "a regular day" or "a boring day" as a negative. I've learned to be grateful for having to suffer through a boring day versus suffering through an "I wish I were dead" day.I know I have to work harder than non-depressed people at some things, so I learn to work my butt off when I want to achieve my goals. Because of this, I think I may have achieved more goals than I may have if I weren't depressive.(Apparently many achievements come to people who work their butts off, regardless of their neurobiology.)Depression and I have long embraced in this awkward dance, where I learned ways to avoid depression's stiletto heels stabbing pinning my feet in place.And I ouch am a ouch slow holy shit that one went clear through my foot learner ouch.After a while, I notice how people forget about the scars on my feet and instead, appreciate the way I dance.Not for Reproduction}}}

In depressives, this fear shows up as self-hating beliefs. Perhaps depression is our most honest beckoning to see things more clearly.In my experience of looking for solutions over fifteen years, I found that the conventional wisdom (medication, excercise, simplyfying life and so on) works to an extent, but not permanently.What worked and what I suggest to people, depressed or not (for everyone is burdened by the fear of life):1. Learn a good release technique. The one I use is effective and becomes second-nature quickly: How to Release Big and Small Emotions (Release)2. Do the spiritual inquiry of looking at the sense of I AM. It's described in many works and traditions; but I think currently John Sherman describes it most simply and most clearly. Check out Just One Look. It's that simple.3. Learn to notice what goes on inside.  Observe as a watcher without analyzing or judging. Observe easily without effort. Observe emotion as senations in the body. Observe thoughts. As you observe, thoughts will slow down, become distinct and spaced. Observe the space in-between thoughts.I have to be thankful to the pain of depression for motivating me to look for a permanent solution.}}}

Not one.This is like asking "How has having tuberculosis improved your life?" or "Don't you think your chronic asthma has given you a helpful perspective?" or "What positives has losing your healthy left foot added to your life?" Depression is a nasty, pernicious illness, not a means to self-improvement. It perpetuates itself in part with a seductive tale of self-justification. "I am here because you are smart and perceptive. I make you more empathetic, more self-aware. I help you think more deeply. You will not be creative without me.  I help you see the truth."It is lying.Depression has soured my relationships, destroyed my self-confidence. It has trapped me in a tar pit of despairing inaction. Far from making me more gentle and empathetic, it makes me paranoid, vicious, and defensive. It has negatively affected my education and work. It has confused healthy self-improvement with unhealthy self-destruction. It has made me desperate enough to take medications that make me feel flat and sluggish, like I have a head full of cotton, in order to be a halfway functional member of society.It is as if a shadow has been following me around all my life, and it casts itself over everything I do. Even in times of remission I can feel it lurking in the background. I am terrified of its return.You can be smart, functional, empathetic, self-aware, creative, perceptive, and kind without depression. You are more likely to be all of those things without depression.

The truth is that I'm basically running around peering at the world through a toilet paper tube, focusing on random bits of the world. But my experience is one of complete perception and awareness. It's good to be reminded how little we actually can see. (For example: Gorillas in our Midst.)Emotions are the same way. Most people go around generally believing that their feelings mean something about the world around them, not their interior state. That is, instead of saying, "I am uncomfortable around a person who looks different than the people I am used to," they say, "There's something wrong with that guy."Mood disorders can help us see that emotions aren't always meaningful. And that even when they are, they might mean something other than we'd first think. That is an opportunity for wisdom, and I think I have benefited greatly from a reflexive questioning, an ongoing inclination to always maintain a bit of doubt, especially about the things that seem self-evidently true.}}}

I can make guesses about what other people are not saying that are surprisingly accurate, and I can share my experience and I find that other people really relate to it. Depression, oddly, adds a kind of intensity to my life that I sometimes prefer over a flat, ordinary set of emotions. Of course, I'd prefer to be happy, but if I can't be happy, being depressed seems to call out to me. In judicious doses, it can scare me and make me do things. It forces me to change, because if I don't do anything, and I fall into it, I could die. So it definitely makes my life seem a bit more on the edge. Things matter more, even as I am less capable of doing anything about them.}}}

I work in stroke and head injury / neuro rehab where I see a lot of patients and / or family who have issues with mental health.  I think it's made me more understanding of how depression does not just affect your mood, it effects your concentration, memory, etc. When I had the episode of severe depression, I realized what's that my goal is not " happiness" in the traditional sense.. But a sense of " well being" that things will be okay. I actually find it less stressful when I stop worrying if I am " happy.". Thats probably me and my own issues, but sometimes focusing on being happy sometimes is counterproductive.Not being depressed means I feel connected to people and things, I don't feel apathetic, I feel meaning in life.}}}

Some phrases which would have accurately described me back then was: smart-ass, over-confident, arrogant, short-tempered and "ego the size of a small planet". A series of hard rejections, both on the social and professional fronts, struck me within a short time span and I dropped into a steep depression. I became socially isolated, I'd cry to myself time and again, and I wanted to end it all. This went on for a little more than a year before I got out of it.Three years later, no one I meet today believes me when I tell them that I was once short-tempered or arrogant. Heck, even those who knew me before my depression tell me that they couldn't believe how much I'd changed after it.So yes, depression is terrible and I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. But once you're out of it, you see yourself and the world around you differently. In my case, I did come out of it a better person.}}}

It's taught me that happiness is completely unrelated to things usually associated with happiness - things like money, success at work and success romantically. Happiness is really just about you and about making sure that you do the things that make you happy.edit - I just read the part in the question about this acting as inspiration for someone -This is what I do.I think about what I'm thankful for. I really try, even if I can't. Except I don't just 'think' it, I try and 'live it' - I try and remember a specific experience I am thankful for and really 'wallow' in it. Once I got good at that, I started to just skip that step - it got to a point where just thinking about a friend, or a sentence would result in that same feeling and it would counter my depression. I tried to figure out who I wanted to be in life and I really tried to make everyday about getting to being that person. A lot of that was to do with being a more compassionate, empathetic person, so I really look for opportunities to help people(whether it be through checking up on a friend - we do this so rarely these days, or by helping an old woman cross the street with her groceries).  Some of this was to do with programming - I became depressed because I had given up working part time, so I found another job. I had also been extremely physically fit before and the depression had stopped me from working out - I started to force myself to go workout, and after a week things got better. The emphasis that I'll put here is on being thankful - if you're thankful for what you have, you're instantly more happy. That's the specific 'thought' that I go to in order to counter my depression. I came to do that after trying a lot of different 'thoughts'. I used to try actively fighting it - refusing to be sad...but that took too much energy and was self fulfilling(try to not think about something - it's impossible). I used to imagine it as  a rock coming at me, and my punching through it - but that wasn't good enough in certain situations(like when I was drunk). When I was at my weakest, I imagined it as a tornado in my head, with me barely hanging on. It's hard to do what I'm suggesting - you really need to find out what makes you happy. No, don't just say nothing - you've been happy before - think about those times and figure out what made you happy then. This was the list for me -I'm thankful for the fact that I'm driven.I'm thankful that I have friends who will come see me if I'm in trouble and who will come see me straight away and that I have a  lot of them.I'm thankful that I have a job that I like.I'm thankful that I have a purpose in life. I'm thankful that I'm the sort of person who won't run from someone else who's suicidal.And a month ago I added this -I'm thankful that I'm the sort of person who can beat depression.}}}

Utterly and totally overwhelmed. There was either continuing at the current pace or cutting to the bone my commitments - the latter had a glimmer of hope embedded into it.So, cutting it was.Those dozens of extracurricular classes for my child had to go, the constant "I am responsible for..." had to be delegated (who knew that I was a perfectionist freak?), things like bill pay and grocery delivery were automated/scheduled as well. My thinking became that if god takes me today, the household will be able to move on (yes, I was at my wit's end trying to make it all work on my own).I also realized that I was trying to keep too many things in my head -the appointments, the account numbers, the phone numbers, addresses (yes, it sounds too silly reading it now); so I consolidated all the information in my iPhone and regularly back it up to retain data.At a moment's notice, I know what is where and when - and most importantly, I learned to let it go. So, if a 4th (just today) birthday party is missed, the world won't end - there will be another birthday party to go to.I also cut down on my friends - went through the list and left only the quality ones: the ones whom I can call at 3am with an emergency, and they will actually show up to help me (and I will do the same for them).It appears that those are single digits, and not 100s like my phone contacts listed. Who knew?My weekends are free now, there is no burden of having to run somewhere because I was late, I can actually plan my life now.I am spending more time with my child - face-to-face time - instead of talking to the rear-view mirror in the car while hurrying from swimming classes to dance classes.I got my life back!And all of this thanks to the depression when my mind and my body told me that enough is enough, and I cannot go on in the same "Let's schedule this!" mode.}}}

Well, at least you won't see any. Nothing registers. Jokes, happiness, joy - NADA. But, anything sad or upsetting has the power to further you in the tentacles of depression. You start questioning everything - your emotional strength, your mental capabilities, intentions of people and your self respect goes for a toss. You are trapped by it, but eventually it starts to dawn upon you that it has the power to liberate you.When I say liberates you, I mean not from the depression itself but from the very feelings or associated yet unrelated feelings that caused it. You see, depression is like hitting rock bottom. It can get worse no doubt, but at every stage you feel like you have hit rock bottom and then something bad happens, and you descend further into this hell.Now, let me introduce you to two powerful quotes whose gravity you comprehend when you are in that depressed state of life and see no way out."And why do we fall, Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves up." ~ Batman Begins"It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything" ~ Fight ClubEvery person is different. So, I will just talk about my tryst with it. I was depressed. Fuck, I think I still am. Past 5 months have been the worst of my life. But, when I look in retrospect, I think it was sort of required. Depression acted as a kick in the shins for me. Woke me up from the dream I had become comfortable in and showed me, that effects of that self-administered blue pill don't last. As I said, I think I maybe still in the throes of depression, but I feel, clarity that has been evading me for so much time, is starting to return. I sense that. I don't know if it's real or will it last, but somehow I see the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. For all I know, it can be another train headed in my direction. But, that dreaded return of state isn't somehow stopping me from trying to learn as much as I can about myself, my strengths and weaknesses.I saw my mistakes. I understood how my little actions and inactions can cost a lot. This all comes in retrospect, but it does. That I suppose is the only benefit of suffering one. It has made me more mature than I was before, more considerate of others as well as returned me my focus on my career that I had lost for so long. Like all things, this depressive state will come to an end. I hope it does. And, if I am unable to learn anything from all this, then you can be sure, if those circumstances are to repeat again, I would be as unprepared as I was before and definitely, will be more entrenched in depression than ever before. You lost a battle. Yep, shit happens. Life's unfair so no use cribbing about why it happened to you. But, this is not the only battle I am going to be a part of. There will be countless other and I am not going unprepared anymore. This depression showed me the chinks in my armor, well it showed me that I had no armor at all. A naked guy running around in a blazing world with no protection for oneself and careless as fuck.So you do learn. It takes time for the realizations to dawn upon you. It takes effort to break out. I have a lot of help. I can't express my gratitude to my closest friends for helping me out here. You need friends to battle it out. A fight like this, will make you a better man, will strengthen your relationships with people and most importantly, you will be free. And, this freedom comes at a price my friend. You have paid the price. Either you can let it go to waste or milk as much as you can."Get busy living or get busy dying."P.S. I was gonna make it anonymous. But fuck it.}}}

If you have social anxiety, it is likely that you have a bad mental chatter and that you have not gone through social stress on an ongoing basis.One empirical truth is that no matter where you are in life, situations that demand a response from you will arise. This might be financial, social or related to what you are working on. When we have options to fall back on - parental support for finances, withdrawing ourselves to our room or letting go of work - we take the easy way out.However, over time, these escapes become unsustainable.One way to look at your situation is that you are under no real threat, and the discomfort/anxiety is a signal to you that you have to be in a situation that you were not in earlier.I strongly believe that such situations can be learned.Let me outline a few resources for you. In the interest of time, I will try and be succinct instead of going into details of how these resources are very close to being a silver bullet.Jane McGonigal delivering her TED Talk about SuperbetterSuperbetterSuperbetter is a simple online game. It allows you to take tiny, consistent actions in getting out of a situation and becoming "SuperBetter". The actions are divided in "Power Ups", "Quests" and "Battling Bad Guys".This can be used to build social resilience.All activities on SuperBetter are backed up by research. Putting it differently, SuperBetter is a culmination of research on emotional and physical well being translated into tiny acts.MindfulnessThe one mistake that we make while living is that we more often than not think that all thoughts being thought by our brain are relevant. Mindfulness is quite close to being a silver bullet - it defeats all the "Bad Guys" in the brain. The external bad guys like an unhealthy work environment or toxic people in your life have to be dealt with by action, although this seems irrelevant for you right now.Andy Puddicombe's talk on MindfulnessPositive PsychologyPositive Psychology is psychology, do not be fooled by the connotations of the word "Positive".There's a lot more to it than I can explain, but I hope that you do look at the TED as an introduction or conduct your own research.Shawn Achor on TEDx Bloomington, speaking about the "Happy Secret to better work"To conclude...I'd say that most of us are alive because of the robustness of our bodies and how normal it is to be mentally/emotionally unhealthy. There is a way out - and that's not a false promise.}}}

And yes, when used, especially with your knowledge, it certainly has the potential to become a learned response. Attempting to overcome this seemingly harmless pass time may well  lead  to making your life unmanageable, filled with difficulties.  It will infect your life in a way that is inexplicable.  For example, relationships will be difficult, managing a job or career nearly impossible, in addition to affecting your chances of ever raising children of your own, should you elect to do so. People who suffer from Dissociative disorders have had an experience, most often so traumatic, that their young little minds could simply not accept them.Consider, if you will, the child who is smack in the middle of the following scenario:The very parents who abuse and neglect her, and possibly sexually molest her too, are the very people she looks to for survival. The child is dependent upon those who are inflicted her with unimaginable pain. Those two truths work together to create an insidious ambivalence that culminates in a child experiencing both love and hate for their primary care-takers. This is a huge double-bind conflict for a young child to grasp. The younger the child, and their mind, the more likely  these set of circumstances will cause a "split" which most often occurs during the  original episode which caused them to dissociate. If the child continues to experience trauma, the more frequently they will use "checking out" as the defense mechanism that often becomes a habit long before most  are aware of it whatsoever. So, dissociation happened as a means of dealing with that which they are unable to process or handle. (An example would be credible threat to their life, or some form of abuse that is so heinous, they "tune-out" in order to stay sane.)  Once the danger is past, they may still dissociate because it is a learned process for them. Most will fight the for the majority of their life to learn to stay PRESENT, and not dissociate. To learn more about Dissociative Disorders, check out: Sidran.org and   ISSD.org    (International Study of trauma and dissociation.)  I dislike the term Dissociative Disorder, and believe it should be changed to Dissociative Response, because it is an absolutely normal response to something very abnormal. It only becomes a problem when, long after the true danger is present, the dissociative response, being so well learned, becomes a way of life. I suggest you search inside. Ask yourself if you have been dissociating for years and are unaware that you have been doing so. Seek help from a professional before you are caught in an endless cycle of dissociation that is self-created. Please know that this is not the same as daydreaming. This is a serious disorder which many people fight daily, hourly, and minute by minute. Although it is possible for one to teach themselves this life-altering defense mechanism, it is most assuredly NOT time well spent, and will not be of any help to you in the long run.}}}

You are just being a slave locked inside a cage created by you. Best way to overcome social anxiety is figure out how others have done it. You also might have problem with lot of over-stimulation, information-overload, and handling noise. These are all different reasons why people feel anxiety in the first place. You need to get out of it. The best way I would suggest is go out and exercise. Don't spend time in your room. Make your body exert and sweat. By exercising you will strengthen your executive functions. By going out and interacting with others, you will slowly train your brain to be more outwardly. Both of these will lead to slow changes in your habit. At the same time you can work on slowly deconstructing the fictional world. Do it slowly, one step at a time. Deny its existence. Avoid its lures and traps. Replace the urge to engage in it with something else. Play Zynga games on computer. Play chess which would keep your brain occupied. Or better still write your thoughts. Your written word will act as a mirror into your brain. You can then figure out patterns, both good and toxic ones. Hopefully this helps.}}}

However, when it's gotten to the point where you need to imagine yourself as someone else in order to sleep (a private, solo activity), you've reached a degree of self-deception that is probably harmful. Because of the severity of the situation you describe, I recommend seeing a professional to get to the root issues underlying your need for fantasy. Learn to confine fantasy to more appropriate and helpful situations, but more importantly, learn to like and enjoy being yourself (especially during alone time). But I'm not a medical pro, so this is all just pure opinion. In any case, I'm sure you're way more awesome than you seem to give yourself credit for being. Good luck!}}}

I think the reason why it is not seen as self-evident is that we usually label cases of animal anxiety as destructive or irregular behaviour and have a more negative view of non-human animal anxiety than we do of human counterparts. Anxiety in animals is treated as "behavioural problems" (like I suspect we once treated anxiety in humans) and treated in humans now as illnesses that can be bettered through therapeutic means, consenting medical applications, or general emotional support systems.Animal anxiety may arise in various ways. Sometimes it is from lingering traumatic experiences of torture and captivity, as seen in animals released from harmful captive situations who have to be "rehabilitated" through human care and patience. Other cases of animal anxiety can arise from selective breeding processes (see: Pathological anxiety in animals)}}}

One of the worst combinations there is.Introversion/extroversion has to do with where you get your energy, not with being "outgoing" vs. "shy" as commonly believed. These are two separate axes. The first is about one's primary sources of happiness, energy, inspiration, contentment. The second is about being ruled by anxiety and fear vs. being empowered, assertive, independent, self-confident.Although our culture is prejudiced against them, introverts can be happy, successful people. The sort of person who derives great pleasure from gardening, painting, writing novels, composing music, conducting research, building things or solving puzzles on his or her own. Not necessarily loners, introverts have relatively few but very deep relationships. Social anxiety is really a severe form of shyness (but not as severe as social phobia). Introverts can be socially anxious and still do well in life, provided they aren't determined to achieve things that are normally awarded to gregarious extroverts (like leadership positions). Social situations may make them uncomfortable, but they'd just as soon avoid those situations anyway, which many regard as a waste of time or a drain on their energy.Extroverts are energized by being around and interacting with other people.  You can practically see them (us) light up when the phone rings, a friend stops by to say hello, or they run into someone they know around town. Belonging to a "tribe," feeling like a member of the club or the gang is important. They quickly become depressed if stuck with a solitary task or project that takes a lot of time with little human interaction.  As an example, looking at common jobs that young people do to make ends meet, the extrovert would rather wait tables or work the cash register at Starbucks than clean houses or do data entry, and the introvert is the other way around.If you're shy but also an introvert, you maximize alone time and enjoy it.  If you're a fearless extrovert, you're the life of the party or the happy-go-lucky sales guy.  The anxiety is a serious damper on an extrovert who wants to be "out there" a lot more and sells him/herself short by being ruled by fear and negative self-talk.  Fortunately there's help if you seek it.  Medication and therapy both can make a difference.}}}

I've grown up very extroverted, I love meeting people and making friends, It's what gives me energy. And although I do cherish my alone time, being an extrovert, it's draining. Unfortunately, when I'm around people, especially unfamiliar ones, I will start to feel incredibly uneasy. Normal thoughts like "that was an awkward thing to say" or "why are they looking at me like that" will turn into many paranoid thoughts, coming in so fast it feels like they're attacking me. I'll start to feel worthless, like no one should talk to me or be near me because I'll just bring down their moods and ruin everything, and when I start to overthink what I'm saying only weird and awkward things will come out, and I'll start having a hard time deciphering how appropriate my comments are. Something very characteristic about how I feel is my very apparent mental blocks. When I face a situation my mind interprets as stressful my mind starts screaming "stop stop stop stop stop", adrenaline will start rushing, and my head will instantly fill with different ways to avoid the stressful situation. It's either that or I won't hear anything, all I have is the awful adrenaline rush, and when that's all I feel my brain sounds like it's full of white noise, like a high pitched beep when the TV is on the wrong channel. Often times if I'm talking to someone and my anxiety triggers in the middle, the entire conversation will blank from my head until they remind me of what we were talking about. It's also very difficult to leave the house, once I'm actually out I realize and know it's not that scary, it's not bad at all. But when I'm there with the world looming in at me it seems like all of the outside is impending doom. Scientifically, I've learned, a lot of this is due to my flight response, reacting at small situations that my mind perceives as more serious than they actually are.So as you can tell, this is a very uncomfortable situation, I crave for social interaction and attention, but when I get it I feel all the pressure of being around people. When I'm alone, I want to be around people, when I'm around people, I want to be alone.Another problem is, without socialization, I'll often feel this uncomfortable 'boredom' energy. My body will often shake when I'm sitting down, either that or I have to be doing something with my hands, pick at my cuticles, play with a piece of paper, rub my fingers together in specific patterns. I have to be sure to be distracting myself by something I can put my entire concentration on, or else everything goes crazy. I have hundreds of ideas running through my head any time I'm not doing something that requires my full attention, so it often appears I'm daydreaming, when actually I'm trying to make sense of the 50 things that popped into my head at the same time.Then of course there are panic attacks. The severity depends on what's happening. My biggest trigger is angry yelling. If I'm in a fight with a friend or family and I get too scared, I'll start crying and it'll be difficult to breathe. Words will sometimes pour out of my mouth and I won't know what I'm saying, usually they're repeats of what I was saying before with some other nonsensical things, but there's nothing in my head except for the feeling in my chest, and the feeling of suffocating, drowning. So later, when I'm in my right mind, I'll realize how much I didn't make sense, and I'll just feel so terrible about the situation I won't want to be around people, but the craving for social interaction never leaves.I was diagnosed with a couple different forms of anxiety, including agoraphobia, about 2 years ago, and there are a couple things I've been doing on top of seeing a therapist to help. I've had many people in my life tell me that "I shouldn't use my anxiety as an excuse", as if I were trying to be lazy or something. For all of those out there who know how I feel, I know it's hard to brush stuff like that off, but they can never know what it's like to have something unless they already have it. Some people will never understand that, or they never try to which frankly is selfish. But there are a lot of people out there who do understand, after surrounding myself with people who do understand me (or try to), things seemed to get a little easier. There are some things that are always going to be harder for you, but just know, you're not alone.}}}

I can't afford to scare anyone off. This contrasts with my desire to be loud and boisterous when talking to people, because I'm just so dang excited to be around them. So what I end up doing is going to parties and then freaking out about everything I did that might possibly have hurt someone's feelings. I also an reluctant to go out sometimes, because I feel like I'll say/do something stupid and no one will want to hang out with me. It sounds stupid, I know, but it's a very real fear.

It's like you're trapped. Quoting from Marina & The Diamonds lyrics: 'everyday I feel the same, stuck and I can never change. sucked into a black balloon, spat into an empty room'. PERFECTLY describes how I feel in most social situations. However, there are sometimes where I really am not nervous at all. Especially around my family, I never think about what they think about me and if I did think about it I wouldn't care because I don't have expectations for myself around (maybe due to the fact i've known them for years, idk). with my friends or people I don't know very well, I get a little bit anxious and nervous but when I go, but I always end up having a great time and I don't think they see me as socially anxious. this happens all the time. it's like my mind is thinking something completely different than what my actions show or the words I speak, I seem very carefree and happy to them, I believe. I've been getting better though. It's been SO hard for me for the past 3 years or so maybe due to the fact that I was pretty emotionally abused by a ex friend, who knows, but I definitely had more expectations of myself around other people after I met here in 7th grade since she would always point out my mistakes and tell me to fix them. terrible, terrible, terrible. She never acknowledged my feelings and criticized me constantly, especially after I had playfully made fun of her in a "friend" sort of way. Anways, she's out of my life now. no room for people like her. So, anyways, this summer it's been kind of bad wanting to hang with my acquaintances and people i've met over the past school year but always feeling like i'm bothering and annoying them when I ask them to hang. I get very energy drained being alone, but then once I've been around people for too long, I generally go back to being alone. so not a good feeling. But i'm working on it. Staying positive and deciding to be happy is one of the best choices for anyone with SA. Whether extrovert or introvert with SA, it can work. I find myself so much happier when I don't worry about the little mistakes I made or the things I said. I just feel like I'm on top of the world. So, it's not like it's un treatable. With controlling your happiness and taking the right medication, your on to a great start. thanks for asking! anymore questions about this subject I would love to answer!}}}

Quite frankly, it is extremely hard, if not impossible to do. What you may expect:Negative feedback is pretty much taboo, because you constantly risk "shutting down" your partner. This may include staying in bed all day, incapability of doing anything, blowing off social engagements, etc. Of course, those behaviors would elicit negative feedback from most people, which leaves you feeling trapped between impossible choices.Lying/hiding is pervasive. The inability to face potential negative feedback makes someone with AvPD very inclined to hide things from you, whenever they perceive potential risk to their (fragile) egos. This can go very far, including secretly not agreeing with life choices you've made together (e.g. marriage or living together), hiding pregnancy and more. Keep in mind here that they have way more experience in hiding and/or lying than you do, so they may be able to keep up different illusions to different people.Chronic lack of trust. In my case, my partner cannot truly believe I love her (because she cannot love herself), which makes her question my motives for pretty much anything significant. If you're saying something positive, you probably have a "secondary, secret goal", but of course if you're saying something negative, it is "the truth".False memories. People with AvPD often seem to remember things very differently. They may "remember" telling you something significant, even if they didn't or flat out deny something they admitted in a moment of weakness. My wife also absolutely believes those false memories (I doubt she has active control over this aspect), which can get very difficult to deal with, it may even make you doubt your own perceptions.Your relationship becomes an energy sink. You may expect most of your free time to go towards dealing with crisis after crisis, if you cannot "harden" yourself and get on with your own life. Vacations suck invariably, if you go together or not (both approaches cause their own type of anxiety).Moments of false hope. Crisis may prompt them to temporarily improve or simply cover their lies better. However, this is - in my case - always a temporary situation, with an easy and rapid reversal to previous behavior.In any case, however sad, I wouldn't have made the same choices had I known about her condition before our marriage. I do love her, but it is almost impossible to live with someone that actively distrusts you.}}}

They tend to get VERY angsty when in public, it can get very frustrating to you because you don't understand why theyre feeling the way they are.I think the key, as with any relationship, is communication. Asking them if there's a way they would prefer to be treated. What can you do for them when they start feeling bad... if anything. Show you care and that you're there for them.If you invite the person somewhere, and they say, "no," then let it go. If you go somewhere with said person and they're all stank-faced and you ask them if they're ok, and they say "yes," then let it go. Plus, that person is always an awesome excuse if you're at a boring party, you always have a partner in crime, ready to leave!Also, note of caution, don't be fake with the concern. If being sensitive becomes emotionally draining, take a break, because you can easily start developing feelings of resentment at all the work you're putting in. I'm also not sure where I stand about "tough love." Like if the person won't take their meds or go to therapy. I personally don't practice tough love.Just try to be aware, be helpful, dont be pushy, but make it easy for the person to hang out with you. Accept them, love them, and all that gushy stuff.I'm not a therapist or very knowledgeable on the subject, if anyone sees misinformation or problematic statements, feel free to edit or comment!Here's a forum of people with social anxiety, maybe you can also find some tricks and tips there from the horse's mouth: Social Anxiety AlliesThis is also an interesting article that may help: For non-survivors talking to survivors: limited vocabulary}}}

She began calling.  Every single call of hers was pretty much a personal call.  But every week she called back the people who showed an interest.  It was usually a one minute call to wish them happy birthday (she kept notes on this stuff) or to ask how their son had done on his big softball game.  Sometimes she just called to say hi.Week after week after week went by and nothing happened... at least not until months four to ten.  It was insane what happened and none of us could really believe it or get a handle on it.  This is what happened and I swear to God that I am not blowing smoke your way.1st Contract: $50,000.00Next: $20,000.00Next $4,000.00Next: $80,000.00Next: $75,000.00Next: $120,000.00And so forth.  It was all capped off by a certain sale at month 10 that was for two million bucks.  And things just kept going from there.  And she wasn't pulling these contracts from them, they were giving them to her.  They were the ones calling her and saying, "Well, we just finished our contract with our last vendor and I've been waiting to give the new one to you."  Weird, huh?These figures are most likely laughed at by large business.  And maybe you need to make sales ten times bigger than these.  And maybe you need to start making sales immediately.I don't know any wise or zen-ish things to say.  All I know is that my sister and myself (to a lesser degree) became friends with the people we sold to.  That's all.Not a very good answer, eh?  Anyway.  Wish you the best.  And even though I don't know you, I personally think that you can kick ass in B2B.}}}

Great point number one: become THE expert in your company's product(s). Extend that.  Become an expert in your industry.  Understand your competitor's products.  Then learn everything about your customer's industry or role.Then take that enormous benefit called "introversion" and put it to its best use. Listen. Because you are there to find out how you can solve a problem for your business customer. And your customer will tell you, if you listen, specifically what problem s/he needs solving. Never forget customers are first and foremost, human beings, driven by the same real concerns and needs that drive all humans. CEOs answer to customers, shareholders, to employees, to earnings, to analysts. CIOs answer to customers, employees, budget and earnings pressure. The challenge of doing business 24/7, information security, etc.  (You get my drift).Because you may feel you lack "smoke and mirrors" that an extrovert might have, you have the opportunity for a one-to-one relationship marketing effort. I second the previous advice to rely on information and data to substantiate your position, once you've determined just how you might be able to solve your client's problem better than anyone else. Remember it is a dialog, not a monologue.  Be yourself and be genuine. Be honest. Because if what you bring to the table is a genuine desire to find a better solution for your client, you are already ahead.}}}

Think about it, it wasn't the product/serice it was the pitch. There were always others selling the same service.Everyone thinks sales is a tainted profession. Sales is a sacred and honorable profession. Nothing in the world happens without 100+ sales people being involved directly or indirectly. The keyboard I type on was sold to me, was sold to the store, the plastic that made the keys was sold to the manufacturer, the raw materials that were used to mold the keys, in a machine that was sold to the injection molding company, in a building that was sold, and so on, and so on, and so on.An introvert may not want to be in front of groups but usually can do well one to one. Most sales happen one to one. Even in a group (made up of individuals) you can pitch to 'the one'. The decision maker. The others are there wishing they could enroll 'the one' in their idea or project. Don't get in a kerfuffle over the ones attending to 'the one'.You managed to get a job, sounds to me like you can sell.Being anxious is not terrible. First time I went on a date I was pretty anxious, it got better the more I participated. And dating has been a blast, glad I didn't stop.Wear your introvert badge proudly. Use the time you wish to withdraw to research and strategize. You will go to your sales presentation more prepared than the other guy, know in advance how to assist your customer. You will know your competitor's offering better than they know their own.Sales is not about manipulating, it is about enrolling someone in their own possibility and vision. Find out how they really want it to be (don't assume what they want) and join with them in making it happen. Forget finding the pain, that's too below the line for me.Business and selling is a team sport. There are no individual sports. Tiger keeps a few thousand people employed and working toward what he is working on. Some of them even sew clothes so he can look good on Sunday. To sell something you need all the other folks back at the fort supplying you and enabling you. Use them, take them with you on occasion, talk to them, what do they say (enroll you in)? I love the Apple product videos. The people in them don't have the title of salesperson but their commentary is compelling.You are one lucky dude or dudette. I hope I have sold you on this idea that you can do fabuously. ;-)}}}

Now people are impressed by my sales skills, but what I mostly learned to do was use my skills and the positive qualities of being an introvert - focusing on a few people, listening well, and letting the client talk more than I do, because sales is really providing a solution they need to a problem they do not know how to define.Sales is really about defining the problem and delivering a solution, and my style works against some top sales folks because they are pushing for a sale, doing all sorts of tricks and techniques.What I've learned is simple; the more the client talks and let's me know what they need, the more I sell (within reason, I don't let them chat forever and get distracted). For me, that also means the more value I deliver, which is as important to me as delivering the sale.The stage you are at is common, introvert or not; sales is all about making the sale, making numbers, and building relationships. The pressure is on...People do two things in the face of pressure; they fold, doubt, and rationalize away reasons not to do anything, or they rise and grow and learn something about themselves.It's your choice either way, and choosing does not make you successful.For example some here seem to wonder about you getting the job with a "little luck and bluff"...welcome to sales. Sales is built on confidence, listening, and answering questions. Consider this; you sold the person on the business that you could do the job.There is a little luck and bluff involved in sales as well, and all you have to do is just keep trying it. The worst thing that can happen is it's wrong for you and you try something else.As a fellow introvert, I appreciate that what you are really doing is challenging those social skills to grow. You may never be the stereotypical, extroverted salesperson, but I can tell you that people are not just stereotypes, they come in all kinds.Sales skills will help you in your career, help you if you're an entrepreneur, and help your social skills.And the fear you feel is real, and good - you are challenging yourself to change, or at least try to, and that's what the game of business and life is, because we are always changing, always growing, always learning.Just consider this a learning experience and see what you learn about yourself making it work, and if you don't, you still grow.}}}

Your anxiety is normal for a person with no experience in sales. In fact, many star sales people also get nervous when approaching sales situations. Great sales people are hard to find, therefore, companies offer up massive salaries for top sales/biz dev people.Knowledge in your industry and experience will help ease your feelings over time. Separate your emotions from your job, understand that when the customer is saying no to you, it's not YOU, but the role you represent. Rejections are hard, but it does get easier when you learn not to take it personally.On the personal front, get out to some random meetup events in your city and meet people to practice striking up conversation with anyone, anywhere.I've been in sales/biz dev for 10 years. From what I've seen, the difference between a good and bad sales person is the willingness to go the extra mile -- you'll soon see that not many people actually step outside their comfort zone for a cold lead.

And even if you don't end up with a sale, you've hopefully had a good conversation.There are certainly other skills you will need to develop.  Being able to read between the lines, effective communication, negotiating, etc.  But being able to talk to people is the #1 skill you need.In some ways a well trained introvert is better at sales than a natural extrovert.  A well trained introvert will learn what a person really means when they say something, they will notice hesitations, closing signs, shifts in body language, etc even more than perhaps someone who is used to coasting on their natural ability to make friends.I've now the sales lead at a well regarded Web 2.0 company and doing well.  And it all started with a quiet, anti-social geek wanting to be something more.If you're at the right company, sales can be a rewarding career (financially and otherwise).  Best of luck to you.}}}

You bluffed your way into a job?2. You pursued (and accepted) a job for the sake of "good therapy"?3. Although unstated, are you thinking that "the answer lies within yourself, all you have to do is cough-up some willpower and skills, and your anxiety will disappear?  (It sounds so lovely, but change just doesn't happen that way.)  These are your problems; being introverted is not your problem.   If you decide to stick with this job, here is what I would do (advice from someone in the introvert camp)1. Toastmasters is good2. Explore 12 step groups; there are lots of Anonymous groups out there, & if you're unfamiliar with 12-step, it's a different format than Toastmasters.  Both are valuable, both have their uses.3. I saw Dale Carnegie's book mentioned, yes that's a good read.  I also recommend "The Friendship Factor" by Alan Loy McGinnis.  By the way, the self-help books are only good for bringing attention to an area in your life.  See a therapist for help putting these structures into place... bringing me to #4:4. If you're not in therapy, why?  You mentioned Social Anxiety... is this an official diagnosis, or are you simply using the phrase for the sake of asking your question?  If you truly suspect you have a social disorder, call a therapist asap.  First of all, the fact you (may) have an anxiety disorder is reason enough to seek therapy and possible meds.  Secondly, how much time do sales people spend on the job, on average?  A lot, right?  You're willing to put yourself through 40+ hours per week with excruciating mental pain?  It's not this job that will improve you as a person... it's the experience of putting the correct support in place in your life that will improve you.  If you're thinking this job will miraculously spawn a skillset, please know that it doesn't happen that way.  Please let us (or me, at least) know how things go for you.  Best of Luck to you!}}}

And  yes, sometimes you've to provide lot of thrust to get you started. But believe you me, you can do it. I have been constantly surprised by my hidden strengths (  and this is NOT a self-promotion :).  Probably, I didn't know very well about me at the beginning..So, first thing, believe that this is possible.Now some strategies/tactics  which helped me (this is from a B2B sales perspective) :1. Know your product and know your competition products very well. Always remember to get your pre-sales when you get into advanced technical discussion ( May be in the third call)2. Prioritize your accounts and opportunity.  Don't run after every opportunity . Let the high effort/low return accounts do business with your competition :) 3.  Think customer. Try to earn their trust . Remember, this takes time. Build relationship over time. Visit them often. And respect their time.4. Do not be in a hurry to tell them what you know. Shut up and listen to them. Figure out how your solution can be positioned to address their core need. Your product can do many things but please make sure it is ALSO solving the problem he has.5. Leverage your channel partners, so that you don't have to run for small opportunity ( I was in a B2B sales ). And for this enable them- train them, tell them how to recognize opportunity.6. As an introvert,  focus is your strength . So, always focus on closing a deal. Think what all you should do to close a deal. Is it a little reduction in price? Is it early delivery? Is it a prime support? Focus on doing everything you need to do to close the deal. Play on your strength.Lastly, force yourself to go out and do things even if you don't feel like doing it. Sometimes you might not like things in the beginning but if you press ahead, you might start liking them .  And this may also change you as a person at least to some extent.Remember, Introversion is a psychological preference, not any weakness. All the best !}}}

Look like you're someone people want to know.Develop an interest in other people and what they are interested in. The best part about sales is that it is all about the other person and not about you...whew!Create a strong external focus.

I spent a lot of time alone. I was, and still am, the observer. Now I use my observations to build relationships and systems that improve those relationships further. Everyone has their own formula for making adjustments that set their trajectory in life. Get to know yourself; the way you work out problems in your head, the way you use your body language, and the way you use your words.

It does not mean you are just nervous about speaking in public or have anxiety in social settings. It means that you derive motivation from within, from drawing upon your internal resources. There are many introverts who have very high-profile and public jobs. Many introverts are actors, in fact. It has nothing to do with how you feel about people outside of yourself and everything to do with what you rely on to complete tasks or to derive motivation.}}}

Every salesman when they first start is extremely nervous for the first three dozen cold calls on the phone, and their first half dozen in person appointments. Its human nature to be nervous so just realize it is normal and try to deal with it accordingly.As for being introverted, I've known several very successful B2B salesman that were natural introverts, but excelled in sales. As Leith Tarling mentions, knowing your product exceptionally well will serve you well while speaking with prospective clients. Another thing you should consider is building a foundation of non-business questions you can choose to ask that helps prospects connect with you on a personal level e.g. where did you go to school, are you married, do you have any kids, are you a golfer/have hobbies, are you a fan of Angles|Dodgers|Lakers|Chargers|Galaxy (you pick the sport and team). If you see anything on their profiles/office walls that indicate involvement in anything that is work/non-work related ask them about it. People like talking about their personal lives, interests, and proactive career involvement.Reading sales books should be obvious to you, in your particular case I would suggest you read Andrew Carnegie's "How To Win Friends And Influence People" to help you work through your social issues. After you've read it then then go back and re-read it and break it down like you would if every bit of information in the book might be on a math exam. You need this information to resonate in you if you want to be successful in your new career.Good luck!}}}

An introvert can do a lot of research and such great prep that he won't have to push hard during sales. Only explain specific benefits. Infact I have seen some guys like that and they come out as honest, trustworthy and less annoying sales guys as they don't pressurize you2) sell a good product. Choose a company and product/services that are really good. You as a person think it's a highly salable idea. Blair witch project sold millions of copies without any marketing or ad spend. Also it didn't involve top dollars as is the case in Hollywood movies. A good product or service would require minimal efforts to sell3) the above two suggestions were in case you will always be an introvert. The other option is to try to become an extrovert or atleast normal...get in the company of extrovert friends, girlfriend etc. Travel to different parts of the part, interact with people. Do some courses such as toastmasters}}}

They just cover it up with a stream of words and actions, so that they may forget about their fears for a while. Point being, anxiety does not arise from having this or that inclination, it's more about whether you feel your behaviour is reflecting your desires.Anxiety, for those who are introverted, is wanting to meet new people but finding a room of strangers utterly overwhelming or terrifying. It's wanting to say something but being continually choked up by fears of being shot down or misunderstood. It's where your actions don't translate your inner thoughts, which at its worst can be traumatising.Society outwardly praises extraverted behaviour and so many quieter types can accumulate a sense of guilt from an early age about not being 'open' or 'spontaneous' enough. But it is actually quite possible for a happy introvert to go to a party and be a wallflower, mostly people-watching and having a couple of decent one-on-one encounters. Or to be content with their own thoughts, without needing them continually validated by others in the back-and-forth of conversation. It can be a happy, serene life at times.So the difference between being reserved or anxious is in the quality of your experiences. It's found in the degree of happiness and contentment you discover in your own behaviours.I'm not a psychologist; just an ordinary quiet guy, who sometimes worries about being too quiet, thinking out loud. If you get really torn up about your question, you may want to see a psychologist because anxiety can often be treated quite effectively by changing habits and thought patterns.One last thing: it's easy to use terms like introvert, extravert and social anxiety and forget that they are just words. They may describe part of you, but you are not them.}}}

I'm very shy around strangers.Before we go into social anxiety, we need to know what logic is composed of:LogicObservation: Mindfully noticing objective, observable factsAnalysis: Accurately translating those facts into statementsDeduction: Combing those statements into a solid structure that supports a reliable conclusionThe less a statement in step 2 has to do with an objective fact, the weaker the link is between it and reality.Socially anxious people live in their heads; they skip step 1 and cycle between steps 2 and 3: Analyzing and Deducing. Because of this, they are prone to basing their beliefs on speculations rather than truth.For example, some socially anxious people think they are the prime focus of attention in the room; they don't look around to see if this is true, they just assume it, so every noise and movement they make becomes nerve-wrecking to them, as if they were on a stage. They constantly picture themselves, what they look like in that moment, instead of paying attention to the people they're with or the environment around them.In the case of social anxiety, these flawed beliefs manifest themselves through physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, heavy breathing, tense shoulders, burning eyes, sweaty palms, or a whole host of other symptoms.When I had social anxiety, I strongly believed my eye contact scared people. This conclusion is what I drew in 12th grade whenever I looked someone in they eyes and their eyes started burning; I came away from that, thinking, "Wow, my eye contact must be intense!" I became terrified of looking anybody in the face after that, because I was sure it would disturb or discomfort them.All this was based on the flawed argument: "Because that person's eyes started burning while I was looking at them, I must have scary eye contact." That is to say, I assumed there was NO OTHER POSSIBLE REASON IN THE WORLD for that person's eyes to burn.Then a year ago, I read a book on Logic, and I realized I was missing mindfulness in my life. I realized how my flawed conclusion came about.I began an objective experiment on people when I talked to them. It scared me at first to do it, but after a while it was nothing: I'd look someone in the face while talking to them. If I felt too afraid to go talk to someone, and if my mind screamed out, "You're gonna freak them out," I'd go talk to them anyway, while looking for actual, objective signs indicating whether or not this was the truth.After some time, I realized: There are no signs of it.Think about that. Do you realize how in my head I had to be to live with that belief for 8 solid years, when simple observation indicated otherwise?After I practiced that experiment for a while, my heavy breathing went away, my own burning of eyes went away, my rapid heartbeat faltered... and I settled back in to my true, healthy, vibrant self. Those only went away because the thoughts behind them went away; the thoughts behind them went away because the beliefs behind them became convinced of the truth and changed positions.Despite that, I do feel shy sometimes, though. I'm okay with that. It's due to my high sensitivity, which makes rejection hurt probably a lot worse than for an average person. It has nothing to do with flawed logic; I think it's just the social orientation assumed by highly sensitive people. Once I get to know someone and become comfortable with them, I'm everything that I am.}}}

I am extremely extroverted so when I do get social anxiety it is odd. I think being shy is different but a shy person might get social anxiety to " perform " or have something to say. My husband is kind of shy and he gets massive anxiety sometimes about keeping a conversation going with people. He gets up in his head and starts analyzing too much, then he gets stuck. The conversation loses its' flow and he starts sweatin' bullets lol. I could be wrong but my impression of shyness is someone who doesn't express themselves verbally unless they are really comfortable with you and know you. Social anxiety for a shy person I think is the pressure to be extroverted. For me as an extrovert, I thrive on talking to strangers at a party. I especially love shy people because it's so fun when they start opening up. I get social anxiety with my family because they can be assholes lol. I know when I walk through the door the hierarchy from my childhood will commence and everyone will treat me like I'm 9 years old. So I walk in anxious and irritated I have to be there lol. Just being totally honest. My point is anyone, shy or not, can get social anxiety. If you are generally a quiet person who doesn't express things openly with new people, I would assume you were shy. If you feel real stress when you interact with other people, whether they are strangers or not, I would say you have social anxiety. I think the key factor is stress. Anxiety causes stress, whereas being a shy, more reserved person isn't a stress thing it's a personality trait. The two however can go hand in hand.}}}

I'd rather stay away from councilors altogether at this point.1 Comment Loading... }}},{{{I'll try to break down the confusing mess this question.I believe your gripping dread from simple mistakes, to be due with you having to low self esteem. Not that you hate yourself, but that you don't think of yourself in a positive light. It might be so, that you put yourself down around others. Our self esteem comes from the perceptions that others have of ourselves and how they treat us, so it can be hard for me to find out exactly where that is coming from, as I don't know about your life.I'll now give you two possible reasons for why you have self esteem, which could be wrong. It could be because the good you do goes unnoticed, while your mistakes have you condemned; or because you're not accepted by your peers for the opinions and viewpoints that you have. It can be hard to find out where our low self esteem is coming from, as seemingly trivial things that happen to us over time, chip away at us, without us knowing it at the time.About thinking about your future, I say that you should live your life with no regrets, so you can avert yourself from further disappointment later on, looking at your actions in a positive light. I believe in the uncertainty of life, that the more uncertain your life is, the more interesting and happier it is; as life being unpredictable, provides you with opportunities. What I can say, is that you should become an opportunist, if you are not one already. Being a drifter who inwardly thinks too much, can only get people so far.About you doing voluntary work, that just depends on your outlook at life. Some people like to do selfless things like charity work, and some people like to do front facing things such as get famous. It appears to be that you do both, with your volunteer work, and your writing. Doing both things alone, are not enough to make someone happy, which is what I've learnt. For someone to be truly happy in life, they need to be given regard for who they are as a person, and what they do. To be more specific, to be happy after a specific time period, you would need to of had something worthwhile happen in the past in that time period, and something you can take with you into the future from that time period. Not everyone is privileged enough to live a good enough life to have that, which is why you should be an opportunist, if you are not one. Some people say "Life every day like it is your last." That is true. But we also can't do the things we wish to do on certain days. So this is why I say "Don't put off for tomorrow, what you can do today." And I try to apply this rule to everything, even though I know I won't attempt everything.We're all human, and we all seek regard from others in life. This is normal. When people don't have regard and feel marginalised, they can sink into a self deprecating downward spiral of depression. Depression is something that we get, when we don't feel that we have any control over our own lives. Any little thing can make us depressed, such as loneliness or losing a job, as long as we feel that we can't exercise control over our own lives. This is why people get anorexia, because they want to regain their control. This is another reason for why it's a good reason to be an opportunist.Also as human beings, we all want to make our mark on the world, modifying the world of which we experience. I'm typing words into a computer screen to influence you, hundreds of miles away. You answer questions on Quora to influence others. Paris Hilton just introduced a new signature shoe line for sale at South Coast Plaza, to influence others, as her fame is advertently declining. The difference between Paris Hilton and you, is that she can be happy without her shoe line, because she has a sense of gratitude for her memories with people, and accomplishments for the future.I can see why counselling doesn't help you. Counselling is for people who aren't self aware, to help them identify their problematic thought patterns and behaviour that they are oblivious to, to help them develop a better approach to dealing with other people. Not everyone is self aware, and not everyone is intelligent, so it's good for me to remind you (and me), of that.I don't know what much I can say about rape, depression, and BDD; because right now I am only scratching the surface, and I can't really deal with your past, if I don't know you as a person.The problem with CBT, is that although it's good for changing someone's perception on the world and thought patterns, it doesn't really work for people who think and see things better than the counsellor or the majority. Don't quote me on that, because I don't really know, but it's a feint opinion. I could be wrong about that.There's lots more things whizzing round in my head that could give you advice on how to help you, but I'm not going to put them in this answer, as it is long enough as it is. I can only say so much in one answer.What I want to know, is why you read books about postmodernism and existentialism. I just don't get it. Why do you do that? Me personally, I do not understand people who want to learn about everything and anything. I think that people should only learn about, the things that they have a use for. Keeping three books on you at all times, isn't going to help you gain a better perspective on life, or have a cheerful disposition on life. Learning for the sake of learning is a bad thing to do. I don't understand people who like the act of learning. It seems like you read depressing stuff.I've got a contradictory saying that I've made up that you might like. It might make you happier.Everything in life has no point, except eating, breathing and sleeping; but influence or reclusive composure is the point.The more you think about it, the more it makes sense. Try thinking that way all next week starting from Monday, and see what happens. I will not tell you what that phrase means, especially reclusive composure, until next week is over.By the way, this question reminds me of me - a lot!Not for Reproduction}}}

Just so you know -- you're not alone. Everybody has those moments (unless they're Totally Normal, but who is?).1. For the irrational self-consciousness of social errors, short term: during the initial rush of panic, pretend nothing out of the ordinary happened (hopefully you can pretend). Breathe. Keep walking. Then remind yourself that nobody noticed because they are busy with their own experience. Also, if any one noticed, they a) probably have done something like that before, so their reaction is compassion or amusement, not derision (if they do, that's their problem), or b) they were bored and you provided a bit of entertainment.Long term: ask yourself, "who am I?" Find out. Be exactly who you are, always. If you're not, try. This is your life. Volunteer every now and then, give to others. Spend time with your peers. Listen to and take care of your body.2. For the trying to do everything, short term: usually the manic feeling isn't very productive. What are your two or three year goals? I find that to be a thinkable amount of time to plan actual things that you will do. Try not to set unreachable goals (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sel...). Education and experience are good investments, always. Don't amass too much debt.Here's what I call the One-Step-Forward Cycle I go through: 1) Control everything2) Start feeling anxious because you can't control everything or it's overwhelming and there's so much to do3) Give up in the face of crushing world-on-shoulders feeling4) Hide/escape/do nothing5) Get bored and start doing something6) Build confidence because you managed to do one thing. Do another thing. Then another, and another, and the universe is controllable! you can do it! and7) back to 1).It is ultimately constructive.3. Really, the biggest thing: love yourself. Be comfortable in your own skin. Deal with your past because it made you who you are today. The future... you can't really control it completely, but you can control your own behavior and make better decisions. You've already started by asking this question. Ask the people in your life (old ones, young ones) questions. Find out how you like to have fun. Learn stuff. Experience stuff. Be.}}}

I know this sounds dumb and basic (because it is) but exercise has helped me tremendously with anxiety. It takes up mental real estate normally used for worrying. It bumps your endorphins and gives you a  nice buzz. You sleep better when you've been extra active and you look better in the mirror which improves your self image. I was nearing (probably passing) obesity. Had a heart attack at 34 followed by open heart surgery. A slightly healthier diet and 30 minutes of vigorous exercise a day have changed my whole life including some of the psychological hangups that led me to an unhealthy lifestyle. I swear it helps... Dont say you dont have time to work out... that is my excuse about twice a week and it always leads me back to a lower spot than I would have been at if I had gone for a 10 minute jog. Dont think of it as anything other than a type of medication. Just try it for two weeks and see what a huge difference it will make in how you see yourself and the world around you.}}}

Below are few things I have to say:1) Stop  visiting Counselors. The thought of visiting them or actually visiting  them makes you feel more sick.You are perfectly fine.2) Dont bother  about what others think about you. I know its very easy to say and hard  to follow but let me tell you you will gradually feel the difference as  you carry forth this attitude in you. 3) Dont think too much about  your future. You dont know whats in store for you tomorrow. So no point  worrying about it. Also cultivate this habit of doing things which  interests you more which will invariably get rid of such thoughts in the  long run.4) Continue to do your volunteering. Never do anything  expecting any results out of it. Do it you if you enjoy doing it and do  it for your own satisfaction. If it reaches people in need then its just  a bonus for you. Always remember "What goes around Comes Around"... 5) This book is a good read:http://www.amazon.com/Feel-Fear-...}}}

You need to use every tool in the psychological toolbox.If you're a severe sufferer (panic attacks, avoiding socializing entirely, adverse professional consequences etc) then definitely look into medication. Antidepressants can have a miraculous impact on social anxiety, since the underlying brain mechanisms for both are pretty much the same. It can take some trial and error to find the right meds for your particular brain chemistry, but once you get the formula right, it can be life-transforming. The benzo family (valium, ativan etc) can be helpful for emergencies or when you just need to bludgeon anxiety into submission by brute force, for a job interview or what have you. But the benzos are addictive, and you build a tolerance to them, so they're a bad long-term solution.Plenty of people out there self-medicate their social anxiety with alcohol and party drugs. Most of the time, this impulse is a pretty benign one. There's a reason we like to drink socially. But drugs and alcohol are blunt instruments, and there's the danger of becoming dependent -- there are a lot of people in this world who can't interact socially without a drink, which is a bad place to be. Cognitive approaches can work great. You might be thinking that you're the only person in the room who has an anxiety problem, that everyone else is totally at ease. But that's not true. Almost everybody in a social situation is nervous to some degree, especially when strangers are involved. Some people just conceal their anxiety better than others. Whenever you see a big, extroverted performance, you can be sure that it's overcompensating for social anxiety. Being nervous around strangers is natural and appropriate; remind yourself that everyone is in the same boat, and that people by default want to like you. Make other people feel relaxed and at ease, and they'll gratefully return the favor.Make things easy on yourself. Don't go it alone. Have a trusted friend or ally with you. Also, take breaks. One big reason people smoke cigarettes is that it's an easy pretext to get out of a room for a few minutes. Don't smoke cigarettes, though. Just excuse yourself and take a walk around the block, check your email, whatever. Your state from the neck down can affect your state from the neck up. Before going into a high-stress situation, do some exercise, yoga, deep breathing or stretching. I find just lying on the floor to be a terrific relaxation method.}}}

I would not jump into the situation by doing the worst and most intimidating thing like (for me) going to a large party where you know no one. Here are things I have done:Start with smaller, slightly less intimidating activities like going to smaller gatherings where you know at least two or three people and feel (somewhat) comfortable with them.Go to gatherings where you are "doing" something, like a game party or something (but only if you enjoy games). Sometimes just the act of meeting people and having to make small talk is very anxiety provoking. If you can focus on some other event that you enjoy it is that much easier to make it through these social situations.Don't stay for too long. Make a plan beforehand. If you know you are going to feel discomfort just tell yourself you will only stay for 45 minutes or if that is too long, a half hour and if your discomfort is truly overwhelming you can duck out sooner.You might try signing up for group therapy. This can be extraordinary helpful in learning to interact effectively and communicate directly and you learn to interact in a "safe" environment.Good luck, in my experience getting to the event in question is half the battle.}}}

The symptoms were complete loss of apetite, inability to sleep unless sitting up (watching TV) and typical asthma symptoms. I also had uncontrollable twitching of my pectoral muscles. I had opted to stay home and care for the pets, while my wife and son went to visit her sister for the period Dec. 20 - Jan. 1. I guess it could be called "separation anxiety" but for the first few days after they returned, it didn't improve. The ER doc indicated that it was not asthma-realated but simply anxiety and gave me a shot of Ativan and a prescription for Ativan pills. It worked like magic. That afternoon we stopped for a great meal at our favorite resturaunt and after, I proptly fell asleep for hours on the couch. Each day after that for a month, I took one Ativan every morning at 6 am, just as I was leaving for work and had a glass of Chardoney with lunch around noon. My doctor told me that Chardonay would simply extend the effects of the Ativan (which wear-off in about 5 hours). It turned out that the probable cause was changes in the workplace that had me seriously worried about my job situation. Once things settled-down at work, I discontinued the Ativan and everything was fine - in other words, I did not find it "habit forming" (althougfh Chardoney may be!).}}}

The method most effective is the one developed at UCLA by Dr. Jeffrey Schwartz, the four-step method. There is extensive research supporting the effectiveness of this method, especially for OCD treatment, but it is just as effective with other anxiety disorders. By using the four steps of 1) relabeling, 2) reframing, 3) refocusing, and 4) revaluing the symptoms, one can achieve mastery over one's own symptoms of social anxiety and overcome the condition altogether.  The difference between taking medications (such as anti-depressants, even if they may be effective for some people) and gaining mastery over the condition is that: 1) All too often, when medication is stopped, the symptoms are very likely to return. However, mastery through Jeffrey Schwartz' four-step method, the symptoms will stay away as long as one has gained the mastery of changing one's way of thinking and behaving. 2) An anxiety disorder such as social anxiety is accompanied by a feeling of not having control over one's own thoughts and behaviors. With medication, the control is still outside the self, in the hands of medications. With the Four-step Method, mastery is regaining self-control over one's own thoughts and behaviors.For more information and getting help please go to http://www.tendingsouls.comDisclaimer: This response is for general information only and it is not meant to be used in lieu of professional medical/psychiatric/psychological treatment.}}}

Possibilities would be a long list, just to give one example: A bad sleeping schedule, lack of sleep, or not getting sleep at nights cause low melatonin level, and low melatonin level (can) cause anxiety disorder. If you have anxiety disorder, just like we can say about any and every health problem; you need to pay more attention on your general health, try to have a more healthy lifestyle and a healthy diet. Here's a good guide about the foods that should help you, and the foods you should stay away from: Nutrition for Anxiety: An Anti Anxiety DietWhether the anxiety disorder is caused by a physical problem or a traumatic event, anti-depressants can be very helpful. If it's a chemical imbalance, anti-depressants can balance it. If it's an emotional issue, anti-depressants can calm you down. The problem with anxiety disorder is that your brain sends the, "Danger," signal when there is no real danger or no worthy reason to feel anxious about. Anti-depressants stop the brain from giving that signal when it's not necessary.Finally... Face your fears, repeatedly. To overcome fear of cats, you need to interact with cats and change the way you see them. And to overcome social anxiety disorder, you need to socialize and change the way you see socializing. If you are agoraphobic, which is something pretty common among social anxiety disorder patients, you don't have to go to a super-crowded concert right away. Take baby steps. One day go have a cup of coffee at a small coffee shop, next go to a mall, next to a beach. If anything goes wrong, don't let it encourage you but just make fun of it. All of us, even those who don't suffer from anxiety disorder, sometimes get nervous for no reason, it's really not embarrassing or a big deal to have an anxiety attack. Especially considering how wildly common anxiety disorder is in the world.}}}

If I somehow ended up talking to them I'd spend more time rehearsing what I wanted to say instead of listening to what they were already saying, and then catastrophizing any little gaffe I made during the conversation. I saw my peers at work and school socializing, developing meaningful friendships and relationships, comforting each other, caring for each other, sharing beautiful experiences with each other like, networking, furthering their careers by making friends with the right people, etc. And all with such ease! I thought, how the HECK do they do that?! IT MUST BE MAGIC. I told my therapist about how I'd been feeling and she, very wisely, told me I needed to stop seeing myself as a fish in a bowl of water. The truth is, nobody is watching you or criticizing you as much as you think they are! Nobody is going to ostracize you if you trip on your shoelaces or snort when you laugh or mispronounce a word. And if they do, then they're assholes! Basically, I overcame shyness when I realized how tired I was of missing out on being happy and letting life pass me by. I wanted to care for and be cared for by other people, just like everyone else does. I wanted to be understood by and understand other people, just like everyone else does. And granted I know happiness is more than just HAVING friends, it's about making those friendships mean something, but overcoming shyness helped me get there. Overcoming shyness freed me to just be me. PROOF OF AFOREMENTIONED FRIENDS:}}}

If someone is otherwise good, empathetic, or wise in general, they may also be understanding, despite a lack of personal experience with mental illness.One easy way to find these things out is to ask someone if they know anyone with mental illness or ask what they think about it. There are more subtle ways to go about this, and there are direct ways. You could say "Do you know anyone with mental illness?" or "What's your general impression of people with mental illness?" Depending on how they respond, you could decide whether or not to be closer to them and to confide in them in this way—or keep them at a distance. If their response is other than positive and they wonder why you asked, you can say "We all have different values. I was curious about yours. Thanks for your answer." Then you can change the subject. Depending on how much you care about them you could try to educate them if they harbor an unfair stereotype, but at the same time, you have to decide how to best use your energy in life and make wise decisions about what types of people and situations are the optimum use for your time.One thing I would add is that I wouldn't think about this as a "disclosure" in the sense that it's something they may not like. I would think about this as just something you want to confide about yourself that happens naturally in the process of getting close to others. So it's appropriate to confide when you feel close and ready to do so.}}}

I have been very open with it at work and when talking to people in general, discussing my illness if it is relevant to the conversation. In relation to work you don't have to tell your employer but they also can't discriminate against you based on your illness. For me I am happy for them to be aware.This is my opinion and mine only, others choose their own path according to their circumstances, I in no way mean to or want to put down people who are not comfortable discussing their illness. That is their choice according to their life. Having said that I feel a kinship with people suffering from a mental illness, I want our lives to be better, easier and looked upon with more understanding by society.For those reasons I am as open as possible about my illness while not being excessive, not boring people with what life has dished out to me. If the real problems people with mental illnesses face daily are kept hidden, remain secrets within peoples minds then the path forward will be that much more difficult.There are people who respond positively to my openness, there are those who don't really care and there are those who are embarrassed, they simply don't know how to respond. Others question how I can work with people with disabilities, wondering how a mentally ill person can have a job where peoples lives can be at risk. To all these people I just talk, I give them my best response and never get upset. Mental illness is a mystery to many people and I respect that and simply try to fill in the gaps for them.I don't mean to sound arrogant in saying this, but it takes courage to be open about your illness, it also takes a level of empathy and compassion. My life would be easier in some ways if I shut my mouth and exposed as little as possible, but in other ways I benefit from speaking out. People have a better understanding of me in general, they can help me if I start going down or up if I am unaware of the changes in me. There are problems in speaking out about mental illness, speaking out about any social abnormality has always been difficult, but if we don't do it who will, how will life get better for us, who in the future will face the problems we suffer today? If people can't handle the fact that I have bipolar 1 then they are free to go their way, this has happened and it has always shown me, every single time, that I am better off without that person in my life.}}}

I often feel this driving need to tell people about my illness, like an excuse or an apology for my behavior. "Why X, you are so bright!  Why do you work at these low paying, dead end jobs?""Hey X, why did you drop out of college three times?""You've been divorced twice?  And you are only 37?""You'd rather stay home tonight?  But it's going to be epic!""You know X, this is the second time you have been sick this month. I'm going to have to give you a warning.""What do you mean, leave you alone?  I'm your husband/boyfriend. Fine. Stay in bed for as long as you want. I'll be on the couch. Maybe if you left the house you just might feel better.  I don't understand?  I understand that you laying around and getting fat is not helping anything!"Every time I go to open my mouth and explain my mental illnesses to someone in response to these statements, I stop. It feels like I'm making excuses. I'm afraid of the labels which will be affixed to me. I don't want to be treated differently. These are real fears, as it has happened to me before when I've shared this information. I've told people I have OCD, which takes different forms. They make jokes about germs, cleanliness, counting. It pisses me off. My OCD is nothing like that. Over the years, I've worked to mask the worst of it. The severe anxiety, the worst of my depression. In public, I hide it as best as I can, and it is exhausting. I can only do it for so long before the facade cracks. Approximately every 3-5 years I crack, and have a break from reality. Treatment sucks, I hate the medications and the last psychiatrist I saw did a number on me. He re-diagnosed me after seeing me for five minutes as a Bipolar II, had me on Lithium, Seroquel, Xanax, Paxil, trazodone and Lamictal all at the same time. When I wasn't sleeping, I was watching cartoons and drooling. He told my employer I could work like this and I lost my good paying job. He told my now ex-husband I was fine to live my life, and he left me. My primary physician took one look at me and had me discontinue everything immediately. So yeah, I don't tell people about my mental illness. I just hope I can keep playing normal as long as possible.}}}

It is not something people seek out, control, or at fault for. However, mental illness is a sensitive issue for some people. Society has come a long way in accepting mental illness but there are still stigmas attached to it. Some caution should be exercised in how you disclose it and to whom. There should be some level of trust you have with this person and that your personal information will not be shared with others inappropriately. Unless your illness will impact on your work, caution should be used in how and if you disclose it in job settings.Discussing your condition is a personal decision. It is something that have some restraint about but not hide either. If they are trusted friends, and they are uncomfortable about knowing you have a mental health disorder, that is information that would be helpful to you in deciding if that relationship should continue.}}}

Unfortunately people do not understand mental health and not only will they become uncomfortable, they will probably think less of you & end up avoiding you. So I am of the view that as little as possible should be disclosed, maybe start off by mentioning the  therapy, rather than the diagnosis. I think people can deal with that more. HOWEVER what should happen, is that we can all mention mental health WITHOUT the concern that it will impact both others & ourselves. Maybe one day. I am talking from the perspective & experience of depression (based in the UK).}}}

I can't express myself. I have no control over my thoughts and feelings when around people. I think that everyone is monitoring me for a flaw in my appearance or attitude (or just about anything I can think of about myself). Whether it's my clothes, the way I walk; what I'm looking at; my facial expressions. I know logically that the possibility of every person I see looking out for those flaws are ridiculous; but in my mind, I can't help but get the feeling that they are. It causes me a lot of stress and insecurity..School for me is a living nightmare. It's where I experience the most anxiety and emotional pain of my day. It's just a bunch of running away and hiding -- hoping people don't see you and make fun of you. I have this notion that everyone is against me and dislikes me as a human being -- even some of my nicest friends I'm suspicious of. When I'm in school, I map out the quickest routes to my next classes. I had remembered over the first couple of days in school, where children are most scarce and where I can keep myself obscure from them. Any social contact at all with them would cause me to panic and worry uncontrollably. I can't maintain conversation because I have this constant belief that he or she is looking out for anything about me to make fun of once I walk away. When class would end, I would go straight from the room I was in, take the nearest staircase directly downstairs to the first floor (I was on the second), go through that particular hall in which there were no if not slightly any kids at all, to the next staircase, back upstairs, and rush into my class. I did this same routine every day for most of my classes. I can't stand to walk directly to my next class because that would require me to look at other children as I walk by. I'm afraid they might say something about me, or if I look at them the wrong way, shove them as they go by or step on their shoe, I'll get into a confrontation.Even if there is one person walking by I panic just as much, yet trying to look the most casual I possibly can. But from one look at him I'm already convinced that he's being critical of me, so I try to look comfortable and "normal" anyway. I put one hand in my pocket first so that makes me look comfortable, right? But then what about my face? Do I look nervous? Is my mouth open too wide? Do I look angry because of my stress? I decide to look down so he won't see my face. But what if he looks at me and realizes that I'm scared and putting my head down because I don't want him to see me? I then put my head up and look to the direction where he is not. If he's looking left at me, I look right, and vice-versa. But what if I look silly looking in the same direction for all this time? I look straight ahead. But then I panic again and assume the cycle over and over until that person passes from my line of sight. This is why I can't be in big crowds of loud obnoxious teenagers; it would drive me mad.During lunchtime, I'd go outside of the lunchroom and upstairs into the staircase and eat there. I would sit in the back staircase where less kids would come. I couldn't stay in that cafeteria because of all the eyes and noise and the very fact that every person in that room had thoughts that I could not control; thoughts that could be about me. I can only remember a handful of times I stayed inside the cafeteria instead of rushing towards the staircase. While the noise would get louder each time more kids came in, I would get smaller and more and more scared as time went on while I was inside that cafeteria. I counted every minute inside there. Those dreadful 20 minutes of torture. But even inside the staircase I wasn't safe from my anxiety. I would, once again, let my brain get the best of me. I thought, what if the kids come back here, see my poor, lonely self and start to make fun of me. Each time I heard a door open and footsteps I would assume it was a teenager, panic, and try to run away from the footsteps and into to a quieter place.This doesn't just apply to school, though. At home, around my neighborhood, I can swear that the cashiers at my local store laugh and make fun of me every time I leave the store.Stress:Anywhere I go, where there are other people around, I can literally feel their presence. Because I think everyone is judging me, whether I know it or not, the pressure is unbearable. I get hot, sometimes sweaty depending on how loud or close the people are around me, and very fidgety. The only way I can escape this (while staying in the same place), is either eating or obscuring my face from everyone. There are reasons for this: Firstly, eating numbs the pain of social anxiety. Don't get me wrong, the stress and anxiety is still there and I can feel it, it's that eating distracts me from thinking fully about myself or other people, so the stress is cut in half. And secondly, hiding my face from others makes me believe that they don't see me, and if they don't see me, they won't judge me.When two or more people are having a conversation, I immediately get the idea that they are talking about me. What makes it worse is their laughter. Their laughter exacerbates the feeling of their taunting me. My head starts to hurt and I look around a lot to make them think that I don't hear them or that I know that they are talking about me. Sometimes they really are talking about me, so I never really know if they are or are not. This gives me another reason not to trust people, even the nicest of people, because of my anxiety. I've lost a lot of friends because of this, and some people do actually dislike me. But they don't know about my problem and I'm afraid to tell them because my problem prevents me from doing so.When a person does make fun of me, it's a crushing blow to my psyche. I literally feel dizzy, weak, sleepy, and even more depressed. I can barely stand on my own two feet because of how weak I feel. The only benefit to this is that the depression makes me apathetic to the things that would normally cause me anxiety. Most of those feelings digress for about an hour except for the depression (which lasts for most of the day).Insecurity:Because of this anxiety, I shut down all emotions. I look like a miserable slob walking down the street. It's not something I do consciously, it's involuntary and it's caused me a lot of problems the past few years. Since I believe that everyone is looking at me and talking about me, I feel like I'm a showcase, and the physical emotions that I display are all part of the comedic show. I feel like every single movement of my face is a means to laugh at me. Whether it's a modest smile or the ascension of a single eye brow, I feel so recorded. To stop this, I go emotionally neutral. I don't smile or frown or laugh or look confused. I want to seem like a person to give 0 attention to. This is an ironic attempt at zeroing myself out in that everybody thinks I'm mad when I'm not (I've been told that a few times). And because of that I'm a laughing stock. Since going emotionally neutral has become more unconscious than conscious, I'm trying my best to look like a "happy" person now. I try to crack a soft smile now and then, but that only makes me feel more like a freak since I don't really feel that way.I'm a people pleaser. I can't stand to have somebody mad or upset with me even if I'm just palling around with a "friend". If I say something that can be suggestively offensive, it will run through my head for days, maybe even weeks. I question my actions and ask myself whether or not that person's feelings were hurt from what I said. Even if it's completely logical that the person's feelings were not hurt (for example, the person laughs after I say the thing that I thought was offensive), I refuse to think that way. I feel constantly sad and upset and angry at myself unless I talk to him/her again to reassure our friendship ("companionship" since I'm not really that close to anyone). Yet I never get around to talking to that person on my own because of my paranoia and nervousness. This is why I don't talk to people or want friends.Social Awkwardness:Don't be offended if one day I meet you and seem like a nice person, but the next day I meet you and seemingly treat you like dirt. It's part of my anxiety: The first day I meet a person I know logically that their mind has no information about me. They haven't a clue about my personality at all. So I force myself to act natural assuring myself with the fact that they haven't received any information from any of their friends, about how weird, awkward, and shy I am. We might get along well and possibly become best friends for that first day. But the next day I meet you, I will ignore your presence entirely and not speak to you unless you confront me. I'm worried that when I come up to you and speak, I'll only be confirming the lies and rumors you've heard about me since the last time we met, or the speculation you might have about how weird and socially awkward I am (even though on the day you first met me, you might have thought I was a cool and nice person). These are things I conjecture from my anxiety.I also can't look people in the eye. Not only am I self-conscious of my personality, I'm also self-conscious of my face. I'm afraid of people thinking I'm ugly, and, again, if I don't see them, they don't see me. So I look away from them when they're speaking even though I know they can still see my face.All I want in terms of my disorder is isolation and privacy; and for it to stay that way unless I'm feeling too lonely or, in rare cases, a bit "social".}}}

Anxiety (and depression) greatly affect my studies. Many of my classes this year have begun to focus on participation and group work for the marking scheme. Wanting to do well in school, I raise my hand in class. If my hand is up for more than 5 seconds, I start to worry extensively that: i. maybe the professor doesn't like me, ii. maybe it was a stupid time to engage the class, iii. maybe I'm about to say something stupid. I quickly put my hand down and internally panic about this for the next half an hour. I miss the opportunity to take notes in class or focus. I can barely hear anyone at this point. I worry whether or not any of my classmates can see me shaking, pulling on my sleeves, looking down at my desk attempting to avoid eye contact. Then, I say hello to my friend after class. I panic for the next hour about: i. whether or not they find me annoying, ii. if I interrupted them or distracted them from something they were doing, iii. if I said something that was worthless. I leave the lecture hall feeling sweaty, nauseous, jittery and suffocated, knowing that I still have to go to another lecture in a few hours. I try to get a coffee, even though coffee is usually not advised for people with anxiety it's just about the only thing that turns my day around. The coffee place doesn't take debit, I ask if I can run to the ATM. The barista gives me a dirty look, says she'll void my order and take it when I come back. When I walk over to the ATM I'm worried that people are looking at me like I'm an idiot for not being able to pay. I come back with a twenty and wait 8 minutes, staring at the barista, waiting for her to notice me and take my order again. I don't want to yell at her or try to get her attention, I don't want to make any noise. I leave without coffee. I go sit in one of the lounges at school and wonder if I need to rush myself to the university's health and wellness centre for the third time because I have had mental breakdowns every year since I have been at this school, financial and academic issues made much worse by anxiety. But a friend finds me in this lounge. Now I have to try and act normal, try to turn off an anxiety attack at the flip of a switch. I realize that I am going to have to completely shut myself down like this another 5-6 times today just to get through any of my classes, and after the hour long bus ride home in freezing weather, I will curl up into a ball on my bed and just breathe heavily and rock back and forth for a while until I can calm down and get something done. Having anxiety and having anxiety attacks while in the public sphere is a process of constant hiding, shaking, suppressing, and numbing - from friends, strangers, co-workers, classmates, bosses and teachers. Some people may believe that the person with anxiety sees everyone as their enemy, when the case is we usually see ourselves as the enemy.}}}

Let me tell you how it is for me.Every day, it feels as though my life is wasting away. Why? Because I don't live it. I'm scared to live it. I never really leave my own house, except to go to my grandparents. Whenever I do end up going somewhere, it feels like everyone staring at me. If I walk past a group of people who are whispering/laughing, I automatically think they're whispering/laughing about me.I do my best to avoid any kind of social interaction with people. In school, I didn't talk much except for a few people. For lunch, everyday, I'd sit alone, away from everyone. It felt like I was having a heart attack while I was eating; was so scared someone would sit too close to me. Whenever someone did try to start a convo with me, I'd panic and try my best to get out of it.It's hard for me to even look people in the eye when I HAVE to talk to them. Because of this, I can't get a job because I'll start panicking during the interview. I'm constantly worrying about what people will think of me, or if they're gonna judge me.I also hate being completely alone in a house because I always think someone is going to break in and kill/kidnap/rape me. I know that doesn't relate to social anxiety, sorry. But basically, it's eating me up. I have NO control. I want to go out and live life so bad...but I can't out of fear. I'm basically wasting my life away here in my bed.}}}

Even though it's gotten better over the years, it still sucks very much to have to suffer with this. It's a very narcissistic disorder if you think about it, because it constantly revolves around "you." What should I say if someone approaches me and says this? What will they think if I do that? Do they hate me, are they making fun of me in their head, am I being too quiet, am I saying something dumb, do they care to listen if I even dreadfully try to speak... and so on. You are constantly just questioning everything, over-thinking everything, even when you don't know you are. It use to be worse when I was in grade school, because at that time I was a voluntary mute. I never really spoke a word to anyone. As the years went by I kept pushing myself to speak a little more. It got to a point that around high school, I said enough was enough......I had just moved down to Texas from North Carolina and decided this would be a fresh start--a new beginning. No one down there knew me, so I could just be "me" and they would never question the fact that I had changed. Well the year started and lo and behold, I was still the same quiet guy in class. I mean I did speak out a little more and made a few friends, but still the anxiety was there and the constant thoughts continued to bombard me on a daily basis. The bad thing is that around this time I discovered alcohol! I would go down to Mexico, since it was literally minutes away, and drink myself away with "friends" and family. After graduating high school, I moved back to Carolina and continued this trend of drinking on the weekends and even started hitting up clubs and bars. I made so many "friends," that I thought I was actually starting to become a little popular. I would arrive at parties and people would yell my name upon entering, it was pretty sweet. I was less conscious with alcohol (of course) and people liked me. BUT deep down inside, I knew all of his was just a facade since that was just drunk me... not at all real me. There were hints of me there, but a drunk person is definitely not themselves or obviously in any of their normal senses.For once in my life though, I felt so happy to have other people to hang out with. I continued this lifestyle for a couple of years and it led to some very terrible things. Firstly, around this time I was in college and due to the constant hanging out, drinking, and clubbing I started to fail all of my classes and soon enough stopped attending all together. I don't mean to toot my own horn either, but I was pretty smart and applied myself all throughout grade school. My family knew I had a promising future, but because I yearned to finally socialize far more than anything else, I gave up on schooling and kept at it with clubbing. Secondly, I went from drinking on weekends, to drinking every single day! It got to a point that I had to literally drink to put myself to sleep at night. I would wake up and drink because I could not go on throughout my day without it in my system. I wanted to feel the buzz everywhere I was. If I wasn't tipsy, I would experience angst. Yes, this means I was out in public drinking and even driving around tipsy; potentially placing others and myself in danger, but thankfully nothing ever happened. I would pour alcohol in coffee cups, to-go cups, and bottles to hide the fact. I still recall this one time very vividly when I went to a hospital with a friend because his manager had just had a baby. This manager knew me somewhat, so I figured I'd go in and congratulate her as well. I had a few too many coffee cups of alcohol on my way there and the whole thing was incredibly awkward. Somehow I failed at calculating how much to drink before arriving at the hospital. Getting the right "social buzz" required a very specific amount of drinks under a certain amount of time in order to avoid being drunk. Basically I aimed at drinking just enough to feel less anxious, but with alcohol it's not easily calculable. It was bright as day outside, must of been noon, and my friend and his manager just stared at me in disgust. I was so ashamed. When I went home that day, it just got me thinking that what the hell was I doing. I was terribly upset and knew I had to stop this. So I did, I stopped cold-turkey that day and moved back in with my parents. I had dropped out of college and slowly over time these friends I had made, were entirely starting to get out of the picture. All they wanted to do was drink and party, and if I wasn't going to do that then there was nothing we had in common to do together. I couldn't even act myself with them anyways, unless I had a drink. So they weren't truly my friends and I wasn't truly popular. I was someone suffering of social anxiety and I had wrongfully fallen into the trap of alcoholism to "cure" myself. I still haven't seen a psychiatrist, although I do want to and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is suffering of this. Drinking is definitely not the way to go, because it will just ruin your life and you could also end up hurting others besides yourself. Today I just work hard at pushing myself out of my little box and comfort zone. It's the best I can do for now and it does make a difference to just push yourself to speak up and stop the over-thinking. The world is not obviously revolving around me, or you with the social anxiety, and it all boils down to changing your mentality about that. I hope no one ever falls into the steps that I did, and if you or someone you know is facing similar problems PLEASE get some help. It's not a bad thing to seek help, and it will lead to a healthier and happier life. I'm just waiting for my benefits to kick in at work, and I'm off to schedule my first psychiatric/therapy appointment. I'm glad to say that where I am today is actually the best I've ever been in terms of my SAD... but there is still space for further improvement. :)}}}

Do I have some type of ADHD. Well no, not ADHD I'm not hyperactive at all. But maybe I have its little brother ADD. My attention feels so fleeting and my brain often seems to let me down. Why am I having such a hard time focusing at work. I feel so much pressure, but my boss doesn't really put pressure on me. Where does all this stress and distraction come from?Who am I? Am I so distracted because I don't like the job, or am I just not getting enough nutrients or sleeping well. Is there actually anything I do like? I read the papers, because people often talk about the news. It would be embarrassing not being able to talk about events. It feels so embarrassing when someone asks a question or talks about something, having no idea what to answer or say in return.I should keep up with technology, that's what the guys at work so often talk about. I should catch up on history, and geography, everyone seems to know so much about those things, or at least the fundamental facts. I should learn how to comment on movies. Why do I keep forgetting the storyline of movies I've seen while everyone else seems so much more opinionated. When I went to a movie with colleagues I was so afraid about the discussions afterwards, that I missed out on half of the movie. I should read more books. Every educated and intelligent person seems to read books and knows so many things. People would think less of me if I don't read.I should learn how to cook better. If someone comes over I would feel so ashamed if things go wrong with a dish or if they don't like it....People seem to know so much more than me. I feel stupid, despite me knowing I'm not really stupid. How come I'm so good in fooling everyone. I've fooled everyone through high school, and I even managed to fool everyone at university, and now I get away with it at work... How long can I keep this up? How come I get away with this all? The stress that I'm doing something over my head is killing me. What if they find out that I'm not who they think I am? Why do they like me? It feels that being a nice person is the reason I get away with it. I've screwed myself by pretending to be better than I really am. I've been pretending so long that I don't know who I am anymore. What do I really like? Sometimes it feels that I'm interested in everything, but is this true interest? Other times it feels that I'm interested in nothing and then hating myself for not having interests.I browse the web, from disorder to disorder. I have symptoms. It seems I have symptoms of every possible disorder. Everyone has some symptoms. Everyone could go to a psychologist and be diagnosed for something. I am however doing quite well. I am a happy person most of the time, I have a good job, I have a social life... My problems are not psychology material. If you would meet me, you see a 27 year old, athletic, sexy, modest woman :-P, albeit maybe a bit shy in the beginning or silent during some occasions... but I can be outgoing as well and make jokes. What is wrong with my mind? Why is my mind driving me so crazy, when my life is actually good. Why does this happen every single day, and why do I think so badly of me and put so much weight on what other people think of me. Why do I surround myself with people that look so good, that know so much, that are so intelligent and interesting. I would be so ashamed if they think bad of me, even knowing they are not perfect and they probably have their flaws as well.Why when I walk to the coffee machine with a group of colleagues it kills me inside. The silence... what do I say... should I ask about their work... oh god I don't know what they're working on right now. I don't dare to ask, because they'... (more)Loading...}}}

I cannot even fathom sometimes how other people do it -- how do they go through life without the absolutely constant front-of-the-mind thoughts about how someone can look at you and see you speaking. Just the simple thought of someone looking at me, and myself knowing this, makes me incredibly conscious and nearly causes me to stop in my tracks (so essentially more awkwardness). For so many years I could not look anyone in the eye for more than a microsecond -- even my parents or significant other -- as then it becomes more apparent that they are looking at you.It's the constant and intense feeling of severe judgement by others, and the tiny thoughts you think you can see flicker across their faces when they look at you.}}}

Some people have been like this for as long as they remember, and some people, like me, develop it suddenly and it's a constant struggle to find out where it spawned from. You often want to blame yourself, but sometimes it's a mixture of different situations you've been through. Everything becomes increasingly difficult. Holding a job, going to school, forming relationships, and even remaining in relationships and friendships you already thought were stable. I'm 22 years old and I think my SA started being predominant at about the age of 18 or so. Starting college was difficult. I strayed away from the things I thought I'd succeed at because of the fear that I would have to assert myself socially, or do too many things that included public speaking; there just seemed to be way too many opportunities for me to make a fool of myself. I felt like everyone I spoke to was more intelligent, had more to offer, and was judging my intelligence, my personality, and my appearance. This led me to stop going to classes and eventually stop going to school all together.Jobs were the same way. I've only had two. The first job I ever had was in retail at a big chain and it might've been the reason I've gotten so bad. I was a cashier and having to make small talk with people on a consistent basis was terrible. From the beginning to the very end of an 8 hour shift I felt like i had to make a constant EFFORT just to talk to the people that came thorugh my line or my co workers and it wore me out physically and mentally. Sometimes I wouldn't know what to say to people or people would make mention of how quiet I was and I would cry. I ate lunch in the bathroom to avoid my co workers, not because I didn't like them but because I didn't think I'd have anything to say to them. All my friendships started failing because I would avoid going out. My friends thought it had something to do with them, but really i just felt inferior to every human being i came in contact with and before i hung out with even my closest friends i would repeatedly think of all the things that could go wrong and how they wouldnt enjoy being with me.Of course, it was all irrational and i understood that very well and still do. I understand that people don't pay that close attention to the things i do and say and I also am not that terrible to be around. I'm quite fun when I'm not overthinking things and I have a lot to offer in a conversation but once I start thinking about it I become very quiet and weird.It's ruined school and relationships for me and I also won't apply to jobs that have a lot of interaction with people (with is most) so I've ended up without a job and bills to pay. This is what it's like. A constant struggle with yourself that you know is ridiculous but still continues and you cant do anything about it but watch all the things in your life fall apart because of it.}}}

Instead my mind would be racing, thinking about what they are thinking of me, what I could say, what they would think of me if I said it, what they must be thinking of me standing here weirdly saying nothing at all...Then, I'd get home and my mind would start racing again. I would play over again and again the interaction, trying to make sense of it.Honestly what's helped the most is interacting with many different kinds of people and seeing how meaningless and arbitrary people's perceptions are. Seeing other people get insecure is also an eye opener.I still often stay silent and just listen, but I am becoming more comfortable in my quietness.

Not  in a prison, but with a prison.I  can afford traveling to Hawaii, but I can't. I still don't feel good  enough to go too far away from house. When I spend more than an hour in  traffic, I have major panic attacks. (At a level that once when I was  taking a bus trip, they had to stop the bus. Which was actually the  beginning of my anxiety disorder.) If I somehow feel tired, I have to  cancel all my errands because my anxiety disorder gets worse. Sometimes  when I'm outside, I start to get dizzy, nauseous, sweating, and feel like  fainting. I can't tell you how many times I went outside to meet up some  friends, and went back to home mid-way because I was feeling attack-y.  How many times I dropped something I wanted to buy because I got nervous  waiting at the check-out line. For me, when I'm by myself, it's a bit  better. Whenever I am with friends or family outside, it gets worse. I  feel like if I want to go back to home, to my safe place,  I won't be able to do that without disappointing them. That makes me  put pressure on myself and that pressure makes the thing I'm scared of  happen -- I leave them right in the middle of the restaurant or during a  bowling game.I  have to confess though. I don't help myself. Getting professional help  is great and sometimes completely necessary of course, but what is even  more important is that you should go after your fears. I was a very shy  kid back in the day, through the first month of elementary school, I  couldn't sleep because I was too nervous, I got diarrhea because I was  too nervous (when you're too nervous, your digestive system works more  than it should). So how could I continue going to school? Because I had  no other choice. There is no 'homeschool' in my country, and I had to go  to school. The first month was extremely difficult, yes, but in the  meantime, I was talking to other kids, I made some moves to talk to  other kids, and I started to make friends. Soon, I HAD friends, and I  got use to that environment and poofff...anxiety disorder was gone. My  mistake now is that I run away from my fears and feed them instead of  facing them like I did when I was a kid. If I socialized more even if I had panic attacks when trying, I would still get use to such social situations and soon that would become a 'normal' thing rather than something that makes me nervous. I'm not doing that but working on it.}}}

Honestly, it is very hard at times. As some other people have said, you feel like you can't express yourself or express your opinions which is very hard for me because I feel like I need to. I do believe that if I didn't suffer from this, I would be an extrovert. I used to be a lot worse in elementary school. In 4th grade, I didn't talk to anyone. In 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 6th I did have a couple of close friends that I knew and I was never really anxious around them, as well as my family. I never hesitated to strike a conversation with my friends and family. I have been taking a medication (paxil, I believe) in about 4th grade and saw a psychiatrist recommended by my mom (of course). Actually not really recommended but a force. I don't think I really knew that I had social anxiety in elementary school for unknown reasons. Anyways, in 9th grade, I made more friends, so there's something positive & I did finally realize I had social anxiety which was a mixture of good and bad. However, I had a couple of friends who were really bad influences on my life. They regularly verbal bullied me and never really seemed to care what I said on any topic. Given the fact that they were both Mexican (not trying to be racist but these too were not good people) and one of them came from Compton, which is basically a ghetto place in California, PLUS I lived in Utah and I was a previous mormon at the time! Imagine that! The one friend that came from Compton especially had an effect on me from calling me dumb and telling me to shut up at various moments; she never really valued anything I said and I thought I was under herself because I was too "goody goody" and she was the exact opposite. Anyways, the next summer I really started to analyze her personality and started to research narcissism and realized that "wow! She really has some narcissistic points in her persona!" I think that was definitely a relief for me given the fact that I had blamed myself for every mistake she pointed out in the past. If you are not aware, narcissists behave in a very "it's all about me" way and have no sympathy towards other people, although it may seem so but that's generally just because they're trying to get their way. Ding, ding, ding! There's the answer for my numerous down days feeling like I was nothing. Oh, and I wasn't taking Paxil during my 9th grade year because my psychiatrist recommended to do that and see how it would go-terrible idea! So onto my 10th grade year I went back on my meds and started to take pills for my suspected ADD, and really things got much better. I joined this big group of friends and enjoyed talking to old friends, and new! Except, the one Mexican friend...that was a little bit of a downer and I definitely did get anxious talking to her after not seeing her all summer and getting in numerous texting fights throughout the summer. But, my opinion did change of her and so did my opinion of myself. So, throughout the next year I did go through some anxiety prone social situation occasionally, but after each one I generally chose to think as positive as possible and change my attitude towards the situation. I did ask my dad to get me a psychologist because I really wanted to get better and improve my self. I can't tell you it's all dandy and good right now in the summer before I start my junoir year but I can tell you that I have gotten better and handling social events better and socializing. So, in conclusion, it really depends on how the person with SAD treats the situation. The earlier the better. I'm glad I'm doing this now because earlier is always better. It really can be so hard and you can feel like your literally the only one going through that situation, but it's up to YOU & your mind to make it better.Thanks for asking!}}}

I've lived in both areas. Initially, it could seem that the West Coast was easier, (people don't care if you dress oddly, for instance) yet in many ways I found the Mid-Atlantic area of the East Coast to be easier than the West Coast. People on the East Coast are initially more reserved, which is nice for most Aspies, but are also more loyal once they've accepted you as a friend. Social things on the West Coast are kind of chaotic. People are friendly to strangers, but less likely to cultivate an actual friendship, and if you have Aspie social difficulties, you might easily become socially lost and isolated.But other people might have different opinions.}}}

CORE BELIEFS: You seem to have a strong core-belief of "I AM NOT NORMAL", "I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH". Well, you are normal and you are good enough but right now that sounds like horse shit to you probably because you are stuck in your belief system since your childhood. suggestion: look up a woman named Byron Katie, her book "Who would you be without your story", and her youtube clips doing "The work". She is a bit odd, but a lot of people with this similar issue approach her. see if she works out for you, otherwise get a book on negative core beliefs.2. LIST: is there one thing going right in your life? You are on the internet seeking help, thats one thing. You have technology and professional help at your finger tips, thats another. You are living in a safe home i suppose, thats one. Sometimes when we are caught up in our "story", we just forget everything else, like horse with blinders on we look at whats "right ahead" (in your case, ANXIETY!!!!)Suggestion: Make a list of not-so-bad things happening in your life. Start with the basics. Then make a list of things you like about yourself, maybe there is only ONE....just write it out anyway. And look at this list daily, write a list daily. If you are not into writing, record yourself or video tape yourself. find what works for you3. RIGHT BRAIN: What activity gets you out of your head? Singing in the shower? Dancing? Painting? Going for a walk? Running? Drawing? Writing? Reading? How do you take care of yourself? It seems you may be thinking about this all the time, as you said yourself. So, think of whatever finds you 'relief' from this issue and start to give your brain some rest. Suggestion: Look at how you helped yourself in the past and utilize it, also try to take a class or maybe learn a new skill, you never know what may help you! stay away from major substance abuse as that leads to a worse place in the end. 4. THERAPY you may need some extra help, dont expect to do everything on your own. We live in a world with billions of human beings and you must learn to reach out once in a while.suggestion: If you are in United States look up "psychoanalytical society of _____________ (whatever town/state you are in", there is cheap therapy for 30-50 dollars range if you cannot afford it. You can meet once a week or thrice up to you. The therapist can simply help you see clarity, and you dont have to be in therapy forever, just until you stabilize. These are just top suggestions, there are more.....read books, try new techniques, and keep reaching out to people. you will find what works for you and some of these may not be effective for you, which is okay! keep looking, and start realizing you are normal, you are just caught in a pattern of repeated thinking. Hope this helped, message me for clarification.*I am not a professional therapist but these techniques have helped me with many situations i have encountered*}}}

It sounds like you have multiple manifestations. I don't think CBT would work by attacking one of your manifestations- it would be like "whack a mole" and your anxiety would be manifested in another facet of your life. That is not to say that therapy would not be useful, only that in my personal experience and experience with patients, it seems as though you need medication to enable you to even successfully attempt therapy. You sound fairly paralyzed. See a psychiatrist- no shame in that, it is the most sensible thing to do. This is beyond something that you can handle alone. Seek expert help. Anxiety is miserable.}}}

I too have had similar experiences, and it was difficult to grow up feeling so different and inhibited. Growing up was a pain.This worked for me. I made myself stop mulling over the past. I don't think about my childhood, or my schooldays. And while talking to people, I would reinvent my life story. I highlighted the experiences that went well, and COMPLETELY ignored the sad stuff. The fact is that everyone has experienced sad things, and happy people never dwell on them, nor freely talk about them with people. It's kind of like airbrushing your past and painting a picture that is more NORMAL. And then share these stories with people, friends and strangers. It's so tempting to succumb to self-pity due to abuse, and this should be avoided. It's a waste of time, and it's not healthy. Just walk away and let go. This may sound difficult, but try it out. Make friends, especially with people that you find "too cool" or "too good". They won't reject you. Instead, they'll can show you another way to think about the world and behave in it. You're doing great, friend. Keep going. Always remember to be kind to yourself.}}}

We think back and perhaps one day have a realization, ah but despite the bad influences there were some good ones, for people can't possible be all one sided, that there are multiple ways to see an orange and eat it in combination with other things.But perception doesn't work.  Even if you think about all the positives, your identity is still tied to your past.  The brain do not let up, or rather it have nothing else significant to work with really and prefers to do things certain way. What to do?  And maybe this is when medicine comes in.  Though short of relief, it may cause a chain reaction of good experiences to happen, causing your brain to reaffirm your positive views not as totally imaginary.  But the strong point comes when people abuse the medicine, when perhaps people are ignorant of such.  This is where I leave the questioner hanging, for I don't have experience except those secondhand, where someone was mis-diagonsed and perhaps are led by such to some life-long consequences I won't go into.Then there are therapists, and for god sake they're expensive but they're around for a reason.  I can't say much about this neither and so I left it to the questioners quest and discretion.  I can't help but to tell you this strange thing I'm about to say.  As you know, life is a journey.  Often we can see problems or we can take joy in finding out about that which strike out fancy.  When you're left without energy to do anything, are you sure it may just be your anxiety disorder?  It may be easy for some to make up some psychological terms to fool, but overall are we listening to our body enough, in other words, can we be more specific and look around?Perhaps what cause such turmoil is the surroundings you're in, and perhaps you are inclined to stay because your brain see no reason to explore, which is all too understandable.In my own personal experience, I have a period of time where I have shut entirely everyone out.  I, like as you may have described, felt I cannot possibly give anyone anything.  Actually, I felt like I don't want to.  I felt anxious about day to day life and that manifested physically.I think the last thing I will give is the thought that we all have our own journey to go through.  I cannot possibly know that if I go back in time and fix all the things I came up with, would this make my life any better than now?  It's hard to tell with the butterfly effect and all.  We can only act in now, and if your body is not align with your mind then something has to change, and you might need outside help (like, real people face to face).  Now that this is a crazy idea, but perhaps you're a perfectly normal person.  Perhaps your mind is not thinking of the right goals or ends and it's up to you to find out what they're, to answer what the meaning of your life is.  There is this hypothesis that goes people generally cannot give if feel like they got nothing to give.  They must get somethings to feel satisfied first.  You must take care of yourself before thinking about putting on the oxygen mask for others.  So as in relationships that blossom when the feelings mutual, when one admire others or see in others traits of themselves.We are not so different, surely what crossed your minds are images and words , similar patterns if you will, hat may have crossed other peoples minds.  So when you see someone who may out-perform you without considering you as a benefactor, won't you say that person have something lacking to need to be so selfish?  Won't you say you're lacking some fundamental feeling that may make you feel fulfilled?So is my issue with medication, that it does not fulfill such needs.  WIth a therapist there's a potential for a professional and oftentimes some life-reaffirming feelings to flow from such interactions, but on the back of the mind they're still unable to casually meet after-hours as real friends might do.There are many approaches you can take.  Neil Gaiman said if you're angry or feeling some strong emotions, make art.  To belong to a community of artists who strive to find some patterns to themselves and nature are perhaps beneficial.  Heck, any community in something you want to be interested in might do.  Life, again, is about the steps you take and not necessary how one 'should' live life.  For, you don't tell how the sun should rise up, it just does because, well, it's the sun and it have some properties in and of itself, and people learn to accept the good and bad about the sun... that it may provide food but sometimes it may give sunburns.So perhaps all this question need is one simple answer that have to do with acceptance.  To be more introspective and understanding of your bodys needs and the actions to fulfill those needs.  I cannot say what they're, as I have said before, it is as much up to you as it is that we all have our own individual journeys, but we're more similar than alike so please don't be afraid.  Don't be afraid that people might take advantage of you, see that the person is suffering some turmoil of his own to need to take such desperate and unworthy action.  See that your anxiety may have perhaps provided you with a unique taste, and to be able to relate and tell your story as carving out the stone of David may cause people to gather around.I don't pretend to know anything, and perhaps I have criticized modern methods of therapy and medicine and promoted uninadvertably the value of family and friendships and community and what you will.  For that I say, don't take my word for it, seek help and seek friendship and seek advice or what not, what you think you need. If you allow my digression.I'm not promoting acupuncture anymore than tylenol (and I can't use a hammer to eat).  I hope you do what may be comfortable for you now, but perhaps just map out in general what course you will take.  Already there are many answers here that generalize what you need, but they cannot walk the walk for you. Think about now and about the possible iceberg approaching.  As in life, we eventually learn to walk by ourselves, but not without a bit of help from someone or something...even Mozart's biographer might of overlooked Mozart;s influences to declare him a 'genius.'}}}

We are animals. Yes, animals. And when animals are afraid they have a reaction-- fight or flight. This is necessary to continue to live and continue the bloodline of the species. Your anxiety is simply a natural reaction to the world, in which you have fears. The problem is of course that what we fear are not the things we feared when we were living in caves pre-history. Society has transformed things that we fear and we often fear things that can cause us no real harm.Since you over-analyze things, I would invite you to quiet your mind. Feel the anxiety in a safe place. Let yourself understand what is happening in your body-- the rush of thoughts or chills or whatever you get and make peace with that feeling. It's natural. It won't hurt you. Don't run. Don't fight. Just be.When you do this simple process, some people might call it meditation. Others might call it a kind of prayer. It is in this, that you will stop worrying, stop fleeing, and stop fighting.It also never hurts to keep talking about these problems with others and don't isolate yourself. You will survive and flourish if you choose to be at peace with yourself. The world is place you cannot control, but you can always control your reactions, even if you can't control your immediate reactions.}}}

Feel the love and ask it to help you.  See love as something that is always there, all around you just waiting for you to embrace it. Know that if all you see is fear, and you can't get it out of your mind, that love is still there too, you just may not be able to see or feel it at the moment, but it is there waiting for you to embrace it and feel better.  Maybe find a quiet place (bathroom  stall if you have to) and actively imagine love filling your heart, and all the space around you.  There is no room for fear to be anywhere around you anymore.  Relax your muscles and let love seep into every crevice of your being.  The air you breath is love, filling your body and blood, and pumped throughout every centimeter of your body and brain.  This love becomes one with you and is all that matters.  Nothing else matters.  Heal yourself in this way.}}}

I don't know if it was the childhood trauma or something else, I developed social anxiety during my high school days. I used to think my friends would abandon me, and my loved ones would die and I will be all alone in the world. I used to over-analyze my actions during interaction with my friends, both pre action and post action, whether they got offended, what would they think about me, what would everyone say about me?Education:I was top performer in my school. In college the fear was overbearing, and I struggled most of the time with them, and it was reflected badly in my grades.I even failed in a subject. I also had fear during my student life that everyone would outperform me,and I will be left behind, as a result I used to study alone, so least anyone could, take advantage outperform me using my notes/materials/resources.Current Situation:I am still suffering from the anxiety disorder, and keep over analyzing my actions and other people's action, I talk very less, least I offend someone, and lose them. I fear that I will be left alone, in hour of need. I am always in constant fear, due to which I am not able to work. Work life:At work also I fear what will my colleague say, that I know nothing, I rarely interact with my manager, least I offend him, and he will block my career growth.Personal life:I feared that my partner would leave me, and my fear somehow was reflected in my actions and as result, I have lost 2 relationships, and now I don't want to get into any relationship because of past experience and my fear that my future partner will also abandon me.Kindly help me.1+ Comments Loading... }}},{{{I would definitely recommend seeking professional therapy, but in lieu of that I can offer a little advice.Reverse the idea placing your Aunt in the hot seat, surely not everyone she knows and that loves her is a moral person by her standards and yet it has no ill effects on her. So conclude she must be wrong.Define morality, go ahead and try... there is no solid definition for moral behavior. It shifts with each generation and has done so since Adam and Eve. It shifts with every culture and every individual. I tried to set a standard of morality for myself and found I could not even live up to my own rules. Seek God with your whole heart and ask him to reveal His truth to you. Study His word with a humble heart and meditate on it until He has delivered you from this anxiety. It works if you will believe that God has your best interest at heart.}}}

This describes in detail my thought process.So can anyone help? What can I do to simply be a normal acting person?[There's more to add; I'll be editing this question periodically for more info] }}},{{{I totally know how you feel because I had the exact same problem. Over the years I really just tried to change very minute details in my gestures, etc. (I believe I'm doing a good impression of being the 'innocent' type, making my shyness look slightly better.) Over time it did help me feel a little more confident when I walk outside, but this didn't really help me speak to people. Whenever someone would smile and be friendly toward me, I don't know how to return the gesture. I keep looking down on the ground acting shy and stuff. This resulted to some people thinking of me as a snob, while others just couldn't believe they've never seen a person as shy as me before. The funny thing is, my parents never thought to get me a psychiatrist, any meds, or whatever. They didn't want to think that I was not normal. That was partly the reason it took me so long to get better. I always had to rely on myself. I'm not completely better though. I am continually working on it. I got a lot better after moving to college, though. New people, first impressions are better since you are more mature, everyone is more mature, and a lot more diversity in general kinda makes everything believable for them. Plus there are more ways to get together - common interest organizations, a little more collective focus on the academics (well, depends on your school. haha)About people looking weird at you even though you were doing nothing, I think it has to do with what you were thinking while looking at them. They have no way of telling what you are really thinking, which could make them assume stuff. Otherwise, they could just be really confused about the way you act. It is of course, hard to monitor your own actions as you can't exactly see yourself from the third person. But I really do believe that the strength to overcome it could be summoned from the inside. What I did to overcome mine was basically to ignore them. After a while, I just started to get lost in my own thoughts, not having to mind what was happening around me (might be dangerous when crossing a street). Note this, as in, really: Strangers don't usually look at you if you don't look at them. They may glance just to see if they are someone they know or not, but they really wouldn't look 3 seconds more if they didn't have any intention to talk to you. If they do have an intention to talk to you, that is um... something else we need to tackle/practice/get help for.  But at least people will laugh at you less for being a "snob" than for being someone who looks at them with a "weird facial expression". Makes you wish you could just tell what everyone is thinking without any effort, eh?But here is what I learned about my own facial expressions: it's not as weird as I thought. What I was afraid came across as weird to other people, was actually just normal to others. And different people perceive us differently. Some are more sensitive to what we are feeling. Like, if they can sense in yourself an apprehension, then yeah, they will act more cautious around you. But it has nothing to do with the specific facial expression that you made. They just associated that type of facial expression with anxiety or something. But trust me, it's not in the way it "looks".Here's another interesting thing I noticed:Some people actually start talking to you, while others don't.Some people are just more sensitive, while others don't think anything's strange with you (until they try to talk to you, that is).But regardless of what type of person they are, most just do not understand a condition that they never had. So there's really nothing else we have to do but try to change our very minute gestures. Don't NOT look at them when they're talking. That is a big big nono. (BUT, you CAN not look at them when YOU are talking. Just make sure your voice isn't very soft - haha, my problem right there.) Listen to what they have to say and just imagine that you are a good listener, as you are looking at them. You don't need to look straight in their eyes, as that is a little dizzying(?) for them. Look in their eyes but don't stare.Perhaps, that "angry" look of yours only happens when you stare for more than 5 seconds. Try to time yourself. Always be aware. I realize I'm not helping in any way with how to talk to people. I'm still trying to figure that out... Just an afterthought: Were you more friendly and outgoing as a young kid? It's so weird how we all change so drastically... There is usually a traumatic/triggering event...}}}

Try to remember to relax your facial muscles, you may have some tension going on when you get in those situations. And make yourself smile at people, maybe sometimes smile and say "hey" in a friendly way, even if you can't keep looking at them for more than a second, continue to have atleast a slight smile going. It takes time but you can do it and it will make a difference in how you are percieved by others. I have had people ask what's wrong with me because I cringe my brows together and squint my eyes a little, like if the sun were in my eyes, and I didn't realize that I was doing it, just in deep thought maybe, but it makes me look like I am angery. I have anxiety issues myself, so I can understand. Be aware of your tension and try and relax it the best that you can.}}}

Wondering how your face looked, whether people were laughing at you, or whether you are "weird" is a reflection of how you view yourself. Nobody can love you until you begin to love yourself. When you feel strange around someone who is not your family / you are comfortable with, try to understand the physical and emotional feeling that you have. Recognize how it feels and why you might feel that way. Allow that feeling to come and go naturally, but do not give it power by being self-conscious about it.I used to be extremely anxious and self-conscious around people because I have hyperhidrosis and sweat a lot. I felt strange and I could have sworn everyone was talking about how bizarre I was. It was only a reflection of my own beliefs. Once I accepted that I sweat and I carried a little rag with me, the feelings went away.}}}

As you may know, socializing tires us, even if we enjoy it. I sometimes baffle my extroverted wife by wanting to leave a party. "But you look like you're having fun," she says. I am, but I know I am become over-saturated. And, for many introverts, socializing with strangers is extremely tiring and may even make us nervous. I particularly hate talking on the phone, because I have to do all of my communicating with spoken words. In face-to-face conversations, I can sometimes get away with smiling as a response, but I can't do that on the phone. This may sound strange to you, but I don't even tend to talk on the phone to family members and friends. Too many awkward silences. We tend to email each other, instead. I maybe hear my parents' voices once a year, but we email often. For an introvert like me, a stranger is someone with whom I can't rely on any past knowledge. I have to learn to socialize with him from scratch. Of course, it's not that big a deal if I'm just ordering a pizza. I can handle the 30-second conversation, even if I don't enjoy it. But I do feel a little twang of distaste at the idea of it. I spend a lot of time organizing my life so that I don't have to talk to strangers. So it's annoying when I suddenly have to. (Here in NYC, a lot of the pizza guys are foreign, and I suck at understanding accents, so there's always a lot of "I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? What? What? Do I want a cat on my pizza? I don't understand what you're saying." At that point, my wife usually grabs the phone.)My least favorite thing is the useless phone call. There are certain people who insist on talking on the phone, even if there's no point. I do understand that to some extroverts, the person-to-person voice contact is the point, and I respect that, but it's still distasteful to me. It usually goes like this: I email someone, asking something like, "What time is the meeting tonight?"He responds. "Why don't you give me a call?"I don't want to call him, but I figure there's some important reason he couldn't just reply with the meeting time. So take a deep breath and dial his number.*ring ring*"Hello?""Hi. You asked me to call.""Oh, yeah! How you doing?""I'm fine. How are you?""I'm pretty good. I just got back from Philly. Lot's of work piled up while I was gone, I can tell you. But I think I have a handle on it."Pause."Oh. Okay. That's good.""Yeah. So... You wanted to know when the meeting was, right?""Yes.""Okay. Let's see. I have that written down somewhere.... Ah. Yes. It's at 8pm.""8pm. Thanks.""Don't mention it. Anything else you need to know?""Nope. That's it. Thanks. I'll talk to you later.""Yeah. Great chatting with you. I'll see you tonight.""See you."*click*Annnnnnnnd: I'm exhausted. Why couldn't he just reply to my email with "8pm"?}}}

More appropriately timing:In contrast to emails and text messages, phone calls are stressful. When you say something, the other person can hear it, when you don't the other person will also hear the pause. You also have to speak. Here, the big difference to face-to-face conversation comes up. When you stammer or flounder, your body language, a nervous laugh or some other compensating action is not there to relieve you of the discomfort of having made a mistake, nor is the other person's body language to show that there is no problem.While voice conversation is natural, voice-only conversation is not, as a lot of conversation is cut out.With rituals, people have been able to reduce their anxiety with phone calls. Soon after the introduction of the telephones, social norms developed that helped people navigate the oddity of interruption out of nowhere by a non-present person.- Hello?+ Hi, this John Paperbasket from Lisa's high school. Is she at home?- Yes, sure. Let me get her for you.Salutations, immediately followed by self-introduction and request make it easy to talk to strangers.Why this still makes people's hearts go faster is because, for the reasons mentioned above, there can still be little crises. When you get the timing wrong, for example wait too long after any sentence even though you're not finished, the other person will answer, which you will have to acknowledge.For example:- Hello?+ Hi, this is John Paperbasket... + Hello John!...At this point, whatever communication protocol you had in mind will have to come to terms with uncertainty. Either you continue introducing yourself, or you squeeze in a "Hi" and then continue, or go straight to why you're calling. This mixture of expected protocols, lack of context information and speech timing may be what makes people anxious about phone calls.}}}

Anthropologists will tell you that x% of communication is non-verbal and that you pick up the rest of the meaning of what people are saying from their body language, facial expressions and so forth. I feel totally ill at ease speaking to people on the phone because I'm denied this information, plus I also feel that my own intent may be misinterpreted for the same reason.People always call at a bad time. When you receive an email or a text, it doesn't interrupt you in the way that a phone call does. I do quite a bit of concentrating, and a phone call about something else can really throw me off.People talk for too long. So many people can't just say what they want to say and get off the line. Having got your attention, they need to talk about a whole bunch of other stuff. We live in a world full of social media and I don't want to "catch up" on the phone - my ideal catch up call goes like so; "See you in the pub in ten minutes? Yeah. Bye".I like to run through what I'm going to say again before I press "send". I'm quite happy to be spontaneous in a face-to-face situation, probably because of my first point above, but I get flustered and stressed when I'm caught off guard on the phone. One of the things I really like about writing Quora posts is that you can even change it after you press send (although I think I do too much of this, continually going back to move commas or swap words for no good reason).I'm receiving more telesales calls just recently. In the UK we're getting a lot of cold calls regarding claims for mis-sold insurance, solar panel subsidies and my personal favourite, "this is your Windows service centre calling, can I take control of your machine". Many of the calls originate in India and it makes me feel bad that I am impatient with them - because I know these are perfectly nice, educated people doing a tough job - but they are intruding and wasting my time.I've learned how to cope with dialing out for a pizza. I can do that now because I have most of the possible conversation paths prepared for, but I can still get a sweat on if I can't hear the person on the other end or they can't hear me and we start having to repeat ourselves. It helps a lot if I'm talking to someone I know well because I can picture their face and imagine them saying the words, but it still isn't an enjoyable experience. Phones, a necessary evil.}}}

I say this in particular because you note that you experience these symptoms even during non-physical interactions (debates, arguments, etc.) I have taken the liberty of tagging the appropriate Quora topics so those with insights in those areas might chime in. I will say, however, that you seem to have had the misfortune of choosing martial arts run by, and populated by, assholes. Martial arts schools run by assholes tend to attract asshole students, so perhaps the latter part of that last statement is not a surprise.Let me assure you that not all martial arts schools are like that. So when you feel like giving it another go, I urge you to try again. There are schools run by nice guys and with nice students -- schools that will do their best to help you progress at both the art and any hangup you might have.I see that you seem to be interested in full-contact sport fighting -- MMA-type styles like Muay Thai, BJJ, perhaps boxing, wrestling, karate. For purposes of learning to calm and control your mind and body, however, you might derive more benefit from something with more of a meditative/mental/internal aspect to it. Something like Taijiquan (like Jeff suggested), Aikido, Baguazhang, or Xingyiquan. If and after these have helped, you can always switch to one of the more typical MMA-favored disciplines.}}}

Does anyone have anything to say? }}},{{{First off, unless you are living in a very malaria stricken impoverished village in Africa then no, you are not old if you are 30. You are not even middle aged. Where I live you are 4 years above Youth Tickets on buses, trains and national airlines.I sometimes have the same shakes when confronting unpleasant physical situations where there is a lengthy stand-off where adrenalin can build up without going anywhere, and when simply talking about stuff from my early love life that I find very emotionally unpleasant. My hands and feet get cold, and my hands start to shake. I can even get a semi-stutter going. The same thing happens at both these quite different, but similarly stressing situations. However, I have managed to understand and manage it very much by taking more control of my body and my breathing. You taking up those self-defence classes sounds excellent, but perhaps one step too quick. I would recommend some grounding and strengthening ashtanga yoga, at least as a start to build up confidence in your body and breathing. Apart from the "exercise" parts we have all seen in sitcoms (asanas, and in ashtanga specifically the change from one to another) ashtanga yoga focuses on things like breathwork (pranayama) and concentration (dharana) and so on. I really thing it could help you overcome those shakes.As a plus the attitude in a fighting ring, a western dojo, a martial arts studio is one of toughness, where you are almost implicitly supposed to mock nervousness and so on. In a yoga room I am pretty sure that people will treat you with more respect and acceptance, even though you have probably done just as much hard work at the end of the day. And yes, if you feel it is important then there are yoga studios with manly men as trainers, even martial arts experts. (My favourite yoga instructor (Encinitas, CA) have studied and trained martial arts since the age of 5 and was introduced to yoga by his Ju Jitsu Sensei at the age of 12 to work on things like this as well as his flexibility. It is not at all why he is my favourite, but I understand some manly men can prefer people like him to yoga teachers with a more gentle background.)}}}

I used to do the same, but after more than a few scrapes, it sort of becomes an instinct that you don't even really think about. Consider when you're doing something else that's taxing or demanding. A video game, for example. The sensation is quite a bit different because you've trained yourself to detach from the situation and view it from an outside perspective. In combat, this works pretty much the exact same way.Now, some of this is also the result of adrenaline. That's why you tend to see professional fighters jump up and down and shake their arms out before a match. Adrenaline shake can be pretty crippling, since when you're quivering like that you actually tend to hit quite a bit less hard, and move less fluidly, than you would when you're focused and calm. Shaking yourself out a bit pre-fight is a quick and cheap way to kinda lessen these effects, and I still do it even though I don't really face this issue anymore.Another great fix? Meditate. Taijiquan, as mentioned previously, is a great way to learn to control your adrenaline while at the same time getting used to your body moving around like you would in a combat situation. As well, and this is what *I* used to control my issues, consider trying to train in a martial art that does forms and combat simulation. Jumping straight into full contact won't necessarily show you good ways to keep the adrenaline under control, and using simulated combat with light sparring will get you used to being in that mode. Another suggestion I can make is to consider getting into BJJ first, if you're looking into an MMA style regimen. Since the focus isn't on striking, it'll feel "safer", and you'll have an easier time detaching from the action and approaching it calmly. Plus, it has the nice side effect that when you do actually start dealing with strikers, you've got a pretty hefty bag of tricks up your sleeve to deal with them.Personally, I start all of my students out in a light combat environment, just to negate this risk. By the time we're actually going full contact, it stops seeming like we are because we've already done this so many times. I've found the practice to be incredibly effective, so it's worth noting.My final suggestion? This one takes a bit more work, but get used to the fact that you're going to lose. I know for me, a lot of my adrenaline shakiness came from the thought that I could get knocked around and beat up. Nerves over how bad it'd hurt, etc... Every bad thing that can possibly happen can run through your mind pre-fight, and it's a bit confidence killer. Overcoming this did a heck of a job on eliminating the shakes, and oddly I came out of it a much better fighter.}}}

Does anyone have anything to say? }}},{{{It's entirely possible that adrenaline is responsible for your shakiness, which isn't bad because it's something you can learn to control. Did you go into these martial arts with any background in fighting, and what physical condition were/are you in? I'm not asking in attempt to justify the way your teachers treated you, because it sounds like what corrupted your training was a combination of your psyche and your teachers (with far more blame on your teachers than you). That said, I believe you're letting your worst fears of how you think other people feel about, see, and hear you, define you. You're letting something as small as shaking be an excuse for you to back down from standing up for yourself. I think you have preconceived notion of what's going to happen, you're expecting it, so it happens. Try this: When that shaking comes, use it. Mark it in your mind as a sign of when you throw your shoulders back, lift your head, clench your fists and confront whats in front of you, in one way or another. Hopefully not in a physical way. That's always a last a resort. So, confidence building aside, I think the self control aspects of martial arts are what appeal to you. If that's the case, I think you should start with something like yoga or tai-chi to get the fundamentals of breathing and movement down. You'll also get stronger will make you more confident. Also, if you don't run or swim or something, start. Start lifting too. Maybe even get a personal trainer if you can afford to. Confidence can come from strange places, you know. For me, a lot of confidence came from skiing and rock climbing. Allow me to attempt to explain.I was at a rather rough point in my life, and was in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in Marquette in early spring. I was with some friends, walking along a river that had a few 30+ft waterfalls along the way when I saw one, and told my buddy to grab his camera because I was gonna climb it. Everyone told me how unsafe it was, and I was aware, but I saw it in my head and knew I could do it. So I did. It wasn't exactly what I expected, as I had to jam my knees and elbows and face and hands and feet, and other body parts into crevices and nooks and crannies just to gain ground (and danger, should I have fallen). I was right next to the waterfall, mind you. Meaning the rock was cold, mossy, slippery, and wet. But I committed, and here I am. The ability that led to my even thinking of doing that came from climbing a lot as a kid. From practice. It was a test of myself in more ways than one. And though I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, I'm glad I did it. Because then I got to find out that I can ski.But if you keep running away from these things, you aren't going to develop the  familiarity you need to climb your own waterfalls, should you so desire.And if you want to go skiing afterwards just let me know. I'll be more than happy to teach you.}}}

This answer is based upon my personal experience, and should be considered anecdotal, not scientific. I've spent the last 8 months dedicated to getting better, here's what I've done.My approach has included 3 major components:see a psychiatrist. if you're open to pursuing medication, the only way to find out what works for you is by experimenting with available pharmacological agents. i spent almost a year trying different medications before finding a combination that works well for me. i believe medication helps to facilitate progress, but alone is not enough.cognitive behavioral therapy. i did this on my own under the supervision of my psychiatrist, who happens to be very excellent. this however is a less structured approach, and not one i recommend to most people. my basic approach was to first identify my anxiety by watching my own thoughts and actions. then i identified the actions i wanted to take, but was inhibited from taking due to anxiety. then i created strategies for confronting these inhibitions and taking the actions i desired.push. there's no magic bullet. there's no easy solution. the only way to overcome anxiety is to make a commitment to yourself to get better, and then work everyday to achieve your goal. focus on what it will be like when you overcome anxiety, and how great it will feel. you'll make progress, you'll lose progress... no matter what, you can never give in. i make goals for myself outside of situations which trigger my anxiety so I can enforce my own follow through.I'm happy to address any questions or to clarify any points, please feel free to comment or ask. I cannot however offer advice to individuals.Not for Reproduction}}}

Family judgments, aggressively competitive siblings, and other difficulties set people up to feel insecure in the social world. Interestingly enough, that doesn't really go away, no matter how much wiser people become with age.We are so overwhelmed with our anxiety about how we compare to others that it becomes difficult to step away from our own worry and see how others have their own problems, too. That person who is too loud, the woman who tries to hard to look good, the spouse always checking on what the other spouse is doing, etc.-- all of them are manifesting their own worries about themselves. If we spend some time observing others, we see their imperfections, and replace fear of our own deficiencies with empathy for our fellow flawed beings. Remembering we are all flawed in some way helps.Before taking meds for dealing with this kind of problem, I'd suggest trying other kinds of useful strategies: meditation, yoga, or other things that reduce bodily or mental stress.}}}

My anxiety was crippling 20 years ago. I did a couple of things. I went to medical school. However, although that was a confidence booster and something to take my mind off of the things that made me anxious, I still found it difficult to speak in groups, and had a lot of social anxiety. I began taking Prozac for depression and my anxiety totally dissipated. I can now talk to large groups at conferences without having my mind blank out with terror - in fact, I am very comfortable. It also completely dissipated my fear of flying. It was life changing and several people I knew commented on it. I am very comfortable now, on a low dose of Prozac. I don't think it changed my personality - it simply gave me the freedom to be myself.}}}

Start off with situations that cause mild anxiety and work your way up as your confidence increases. Try the Think Right Now cds which you can find easily on the internet,which are basically positive affirmations.If there are situations you find particularly diificult ask your GP about beta-blockers which are completely non-addictive and remove the physical symptoms of panic. Also you're likely to feel less anxious if you look after yourself i.e. Eat healthily,exercise(yoga especially)drink less.}}}

Second, examine stressors in your life. If you are having nightmares about keeping your job, if you are involved in a romance that's undermining your confidence, if you've outgrown your highly-competitive friends, take a step back. You OUGHT to be anxious under the circumstances. You are in transition. Even a good and healthy change can bring on social anxiety. Losing weight and getting fit can draw lots of positive attention that many find very uncomfortable. If you are dealing with adjustment anxiety, find a trusted friend or a decent counselor to help you work through the change. If the anxiety has no definable source, there are several decent options. First, make sure you are getting exercise. Second, if you are capable of self-hypnosis, (or can find a qualified, reputable provider), try it. Athletes and musicians with sudden performance anxiety have sworn by it. Last, find ways to get out of your own head and rebuild your sense of self. Personally, I recommend volunteering. Work at a food pantry, a homeless or women's shelter, build a habitat house, read to kids or seniors. You will make new friends who are fun and genuine.  At the end of the day,  you've built confidence, a better world, and been reminded you why you rock.}}}

But, when you really think about it, the majority of people don't even hesitate when calling or answering a phone. To them it's an utterly ordinary event hardly of note. When they hang up, they have PLENTY else to think about other than dwelling on a quick phone call, like - "what to do now, where and what to eat, what's so and so doing, my toe kind'a hurts, i'm sleepy", and so on.

As I said, everyone is different and what helps others may not help you.  If you feel you have a really severe problem here that affects your job and day to day life I'd suggest seeing a psychologist about it.  They have jobs for a reason, and seeing one doesn't make you weak or crazy. You're emotionally responding to something subconsciously - somewhere within you, you know why and that understanding can help you move past your fears. If you can do it on your own, that's great too.  But since you're here, you already know there's no shame in asking for help... there's also no shame in seeing a professional about it, provided you have some insurance that can cover it.If you don't - get some.  It's important to take care of yourself.}}}

It borders on being a professional handicap as sometimes phoning is the most effective way to get a response quickly, but I persist in sending email which may be replied to slowly or not at all.

Yes, I feel like I do not "deserve" warm reception, so I try to "sweeten up" my calls, which is even worse, because now I am sounding really insecure..I am in financial advice business, and should make calls regularly...I hate it.}}}

Make sure they are available for the call (ready to listen).4. Say what you need to say, take your time.5. Now just shut up and listen for their feedback.6. Respond if needed. Stay relaxed and breathe. Throw away the pressure to respond or fill the silence.The more you do it, the easier it gets. Do what you need to do, don't think too much about the person's reaction. You cannot control anyone's reaction.}}}

How does exposure therapy work and when does it not work?1 Comment Loading... }}},{{{Exposure therapy (we'll use a water phobia for example) was designed to allow your brain to see that you won't drown, and you are complete control in your surrounding. However, if your brain can't link a positive to the water.. the phobia will stand forever. So, as Tony Robbins says in his book. "a robust man states that heaven loves fat guys more than thin.. because only really spiritually people will see their good side." Then in the middle of his seminar Robbins claims.. "Well I think God has a special place in hell where he roasts fat guys!" Which put the image of the robust man on a spit in hell.. breaking his pattern and leading him to lose tons or weight quickly. So what you have to do is think stuff like.. I can't live without water.. I drink it everyday.. and this is the closest thing to being on the moon as I'll ever get to be.. Stuff like that that's all positive.. While still testing it in exposure therapy. If you need to.. lie to yourself until your habit saying in water is.. "I love this stuff!"}}}
